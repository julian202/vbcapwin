<h3><font color="#FF0000">Output Device Options</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>These options define where the reports are sent.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Printer</font><br>
Sends the report and graphics to your selected printer or plotter. The printed reports are compatible with 8 .5 x 11inch paper and the metric equivalent. This option uses the computers default printer.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Screen</font><br>
Sends the report to the computer screen.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">File</font><br>
Saves the report as an Excel file or a text only to a disk file. The File Selector is displayed for entry of a file name. Outputting to a Text File does NOT allow graphics to be saved.</p>
<h4> </h4>
<p><font font-weight="600" >	Raw Text and Tab Delimited:</font><br>Moves the data into a text file that can be opened with "Notepad". These two options can be distinguished if the user is using another program to analyze the data; they are slightly different from each other in the way that the data is separated into columns.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">	Excel</font><br>puts all the data into Excel; this option can only be used if Excel is already present on the computer being used; both text and graphical data will be transferred.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Auto</font><br>Used when a file is selected- the Output File name will automatically be set to the file selected, with the appropriate extension for the type of output file chosen, and the user will not be able to change it; if the option is not checked, the user will be able to change the Output File by clicking on the Output File Name entry box to the right.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Output File Name </font>shows where the data files are saved.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Distribution Summary</font><br>Similar to the <font font-weight="500">Pore Table Only</font> option mentioned above. Sends information directly to the printer without displaying it on the screen.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Group Selection</font><br>Selects the user group (set up in Capwin). Groups save report settings just as they save test settings.</p>
