<hr>
<p>These options are used to select the reports and graphs to be created. Click the box next to the graph name to select it. The first eight lines contain reports and text available for Capillary Flow Porometry reports. The Pressure versus Flow Rate option is also used to display data from an Integrity Test.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Porometry Text Report
</font><br>Provides a report of the Porometry test using text only.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Porometry Summary Sheet</font><br>provides a summary sheet of various test results.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Flow Rate vs. Pressure</font><br>Graphs the wet and dry flow curves as they were shown on the monitor during the actual test. A line is also plotted showing the half dry flow rate. The intersection of this line and the wet curve is the mean flow pressure.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Cum. Filter Flow vs. Diameter</font><br>The cumulative filter flow versus diameter graph shows the accumulated percentage of flow through the sample at specific diameters. The Cumulative filter flow is the percent of wet flow to dry flow and is found by adding together the different flow quantities taken at each point.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Pore Size Distribution (Histogram):</font><br>Displays the pore size distribution in the form of a histogram.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Pore Size Distribution vs. Diameter:</font><br>The pore size distribution versus diameter graph shows the concentration of pores based on average pore diameter.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Pore Size Distribution and Cumulative Filter Flow</font><br>Displays both a Cumulative Filter Flow vs. Diameter and a Pore Size Distribution on the same graph, allowing the data to be easily compared. </p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Frequency Distribution and Cumulative Filter Flow</font><br>Displays the frequency distribution and cumulative filter flow on the same graph.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Frequency Distribution (Log Scale)</font><br>Graphs the frequency distribution using a log scale.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Cumulative and Differential Filter Flow</font><br>Graphs both types of filter flow calculations together. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Permeability Text Report</font><br>Provides a report of the Permeability test using text only.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Permeability Graph: </font><br>Graph of pressure versus flow rate of the wet- or dry-flow curves that represent the data points taken during the test.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Darcy:</font><br>uses the Darcy formula (page 145) to calculate the Dry Curve; takes into account the specific factors of the test being performed.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Gurley:</font><br>unit of permeability that shows the amount of time it takes a specific volume of gas to pass through a sample of a specific diameter.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Frazier:</font><br>Standard measure of air permeability.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Rayl: </font><br> measures air flow resistance</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Frazier Analysis</font><br>Analyzes the data to determine the Frazier value for the test material.</p>
