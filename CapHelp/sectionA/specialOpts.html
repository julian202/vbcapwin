<h3><font color="#FF0000">General</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FF0000">EMF Size Factor</font><br>This is a printing option for graphics saved as an EMF file. The factor determines how much of the opened window gets saved. (For example, 0.75 would correspond to 75% of the window. Usually the factor will just be set as 1 meaning that 100% of the window will be saved as a graphic file.) Older versions of Windows may need different factors.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Special Permeability Type</font><br>Most of the time this option is left at zero. If the user wishes to calculate permeability in an alternate way, he can change this option to 1. For more information on this option, please contact the PMI offices.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Fonts</font><br>Allows you to pick the font used in the graphs and reports. The left-hand column defines the font properties of the Caprep software itself and text printed on graphs. The other column is used for text in text reports. The main font defaults to Arial. The font used for text reports should be a monospaced font in order to preserve the correct report formatting; the default font is Courier New.
</p>
<h3><font color="#FF0000">Text</font></h3>
<div align="center">
<img src="../images/test.jpg" width="450" height="382" alt="Text tab of the Preferences tab"><br></div><p>
Allows you to pick what information is shown in the Summary Sheet and specifies the units used to report flow.
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Alternative Distribution Calculation</font><br>The pore size distribution is an estimate of the relative abundance of pores taken at each point in test. This information is acquired by looking at how much the air flow changes as the diameter of the pores change. The pattern of air flow change will depend on how the number of pores of a certain diameter are spread out across the sample. This option just allows the user to opt to calculate this distribution in an alternate way. Normally it is not selected. For more information contact PMI.

<h3><font color="#FF0000">Graphs</font></h3>
<div align="center">
<img src="../images/graphs.jpg" width="409" height="340" alt="Graph pane">
</div>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Scaling</font><br>These options determine how graphs are scaled. Scaling determines the ranges of the axis for each graph.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Last Scale</font><br>Uses the scaling information stored during the last Manual Scaling or Auto Scaling report. This method may miss data points if the data does not fit the same range as the last data set.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Manual Scale</font><br>Adjusts the settings for each graph manually.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Auto Scale	(Recommended)</font><br>
Automatically adjusts the scaling to graph all of the data.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Fitting</font></p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Histogram</font><br>
Displays the data in a histogram.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Fitted x-y plot</font><br>Displays the data in an x-y plot; creates a line graph instead of a bar graph; the points displayed will correspond with the histogram boxes if a bar graph were made instead.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Max number of fitting intervals</font><br>
Sets the max number of histogram bins if using a histogram display and the max number of intervals for between points if using an x-y plot.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">X Axis for Pore Distribution</font><br>Categorizes pore sizes by the amount of pressure it takes for each pore diameter to allow flow to pass.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Pressure</font><br>Categorizes pore sizes by the amount of pressure it takes for each pore diameter to allow flow to pass.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Diameter</font><br>Categorizes pore sizes by their diameter.</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">Distribution as f (D^2)</font><br>Changes the way that Pore Size Distribution is calculated. By squaring the diameter value, the distribution curve is more pronounced. The peaks appear to be much greater that if viewed with this option turned off.
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Y Axis for Permeability</font><br></p>
<p><font font-weight="600">
Cc/s </font><br>(cubic centimeters per second)</p>
<p><font font-weight="600">L/m/cm^2</font><br> (liters per minute per unit area
 of the sample vs pressure)</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Show Data Points</font><br>A data point marker representing each data point is shown on the graph.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Color Lines</font><br>Displays graph lines in color.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Normalize Data</font><br>Scales the data points down so that they fit onto a normal plot. Sets the maximum point at 100 and adjusts the other points accordingly.
Extra Liquid Perm. Temperature Options
If your machine has the option of reporting temperature, you can select this to show the various temperatures at different points of the test. Most machines do not come with this option.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Graphics Based vs Font Based Output</font><br>
 Determines how the printer or plotter should handle output data. The font and word-based options should work on any relatively modern computer while the graphics and character options were made for much older versions.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Page Margins</font><br>Sets the page margins for printed reports. A twip is a printing term for width and is equal to 1/1440 of an inch. The default values for this option are 200 for the right and left margins, 240 for the top and 80 for the bottom.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Set up Reports for Three Ringed Binder</font><br>Moves the text to the right to make space for binder holes.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Line Width on Graphs</font><br>Allows the user to set the thickness of the lines on the graph; can be made more or less visible by inputting higher or lower numbers.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Print Test Page</font><br>Prints the test page using the specific options set above.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Data Report Screens</font><br>After all report and graph options have been selected to create the report, click BEGIN. Select a data file to create a report.</p>
