<h4>Microflow Test Report</h4>
<p>After data is recorded and the test is complete, you may analyze the data using the CAPREP Software System. Start CAPREP from within CAPWIN by selecting Report from the Execute Report menu on the CAPWIN main screen.  </p>
<p>The report printed for a porometry test consists of a heading, the information shown on the testing setup screen, the mean flow pore pressure and diameter, the bubble point pressure and diameter, and a table of the data gathered during the test.</p>
<p>Consult the help system in the CAPREP Software System for more information.</p>
