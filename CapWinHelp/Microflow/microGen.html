<p>Microflow testing used to determine the flow rate through a sample with very small pores. The flow rate of these samples cannot be measured with a normal flow meter. Instead, the rate is calculated using the difference in pressure between the bottom (output) and top halves (where pressure is being applied) of the sample, the total volume of the system, and the rate of the pressure increase. The outflow side of the sample chamber is connected to a pressure transducer which coverts the physical pressure values to electronic readings. To eliminate the effects of back-pressure on the flow, the chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure between each data point reading. The data obtained from the test are manipulated using the ideal gas law and are used to find the flow rate.</p>
<p>The Microflow Permeability vs. Time Test measures flow rate from computations using the rate of change in pressure above the sample over time. </p>
