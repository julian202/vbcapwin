<!-- item #1 -->
<li><span class="red">Prepare sample to be tested.</span>  Sample may need to be cut in order to fit and lie flat in the sample chamber.  The sample should be cut bigger than the o-ring in order to completely cover the o-ring and ensure proper sealing.  Samples smaller than the o-ring will require adapter plates.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #2 -->
<li><span class="red">Disconnect any hose attached to the sample chamber lid.</span>
  Unscrew and remove the sample chamber lid.  Take out the spacing insert and adapter plates (if present).  Check the o-rings for dryness, apply vacuum grease if needed. Make sure components are clean and free from wetting fluid left by previous testing.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #3 -->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Group</span> on the main Capwin menu, <span class="red">choose an existing group</span> by clicking on <span class="bold">Select Group</span> Ctrl+U <span class="red">or make a new group</span> by clicking on <span class="bold">New Group</span> Ctrl+N. A group contains the pressure units used and the Autotest setup for the last test ran using this group.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #4 -->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Execute</span> on the main Capwin menu,<span class="red"> select <span class="bold">Autotest F2</span></span>. The <span class="bold">Autotest</span> settings screen will open.

<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #7 -->
<li>If the liquid permeability test is being performed using a liquid other than water and the <span class="bold">Liquid</span> field is visible, click on the <span class="bold">Liquid</span> field to specify the liquid.  This will bring up the <span class="bold">Liquid Select</span> dialogue box
Select<span class="bold">X: Other Liquid</span>  and enter the name of the liquid and its surface tension in centipoise.<br />
Click <span class="bold">Done</span> to return to the <span class="bold">Autotest</span>
 screen.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #8 -->
<li><span class="redB">Place the sample into the sample chamber</span>, making sure sample seals against o-ring.<br />
If adapter plates are used, <span class="red">place the screened adapter plate in the bottom of the sample chamber</span>.  Align the plate on the three chamber pins.  Yellow chip pullers are provided to aid in putting in and taking out plates from the chamber.  Place the sample on top of the screened plate.  Make sure the o-ring of this screened plate seals against the sample.  Place the top adapter plate into the chamber.

<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #9 -->
<li><span class="red">Place the chamber insert into the chamber.</span>  The insert should sit no lower than the height of the sample chamber.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #10 -->
<li><span class="red">Click on the <span class="redB">Start Test</span> button ALT+S.</span>  The Autotest sequence will now begin.  A series of dialogue boxes will appear, instructing user to: Enter starting pressure, maximum pressure, point step pressure, maximum wait between points, maximum number of points. <span class="red">Click <span class="redB">Continue</span> after each entered value.</span>
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #11 -->
<li>A dialogue box will appear, instructing user to Load sample. Fill up the sample chamber with fluid.  Make sure no air bubbles are trapped in the chamber.  Screw on the lid and hand tighten.  Attach the liquid fill hose with quick connect fitting to the sample chamber lid.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #12 -->
<li>Click <span class="bold">OK</span>.  This will bring up a dialogue box, prompting user to Begin filling penetrometer.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #13 -->
<li>Click the <span class="bold">Prefilled</span> button if penetrometer tube has already been filled completely.<br />
Otherwise, locate the <span class="bold">Liquid Fill</span> valve.  It is a black knob located on the front of the shroud of the porometer.  Turn the knob to the <span class="redB">Open </span>position and begin filling up penetrometer tube until the counts on the screen are between 2000 and 800 counts.  If the penetrometer is overfilled, it will show a count value of 1.  Drain off the excess liquid by pressing on the white valve in the quick connect fitting.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #14 -->
<li>Click <span class="bold">OK</span> when the counts are between 2000 and 800 counts.  A second dialogue box will open, asking "<span class="red">Is the penetrometer full?</span>"  Use this time to recheck once more before proceeding.  Click <span class="bold">OK</span> when ready.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #15 -->
<li>The <span class="redB">Current Test Status</span> screen will open.  Click <span class="bold">OK</span> to begin the test.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #16 -->
<li>The height of the liquid, time, pressure and flow rate are displayed as the data is collected during the test.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #17 -->
<li>In the preferences menu under the liquid permeability tab, there is a selection to refill the penetrometer.  If the penetrometer tube has emptied completely before reaching the set maximum pressure for the test, a dialogue box will appear, prompting user to "<span class="red">Fill until counts are between 2000 and 800</span>".  Refill the penetrometer once more to continue with test or click on the <span class="bold">Stop Test </span>button to end the test at this point.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #18 -->
<li>When the test has ended, a dialogue box appears, instructing user to "<span class="red">Disconnect the penetrometer from the sample chamber and open the sample chamber to allow the fluid to drain out</span>".  Click <span class="bold">OK</span>.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #19 -->
<li>The <span class="redB">Test Done</span> dialogue box will then come up.  Click <span class="bold">OK.</span>

<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #20 -->
<li>Test results may be viewed and analyzed using <span class="bold">CapRep</span>. To access <span class="bold">CapRep</span> from the <span class="bold">Capwin</span>
 main menu, select <span class="bold">Report</span> and click on <span class="bold">Execute Report F4</span>.
