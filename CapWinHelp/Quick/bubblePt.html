<!-- item #1 -->
<li><span class="redB">Open sample chamber.</span>  Disconnect the air hose attached to the sample chamber lid.  Unscrew and remove the lid.  Take out the spacing insert and adapter plates (if provided).  Check the o-rings for dryness, apply vacuum grease if needed.  Make sure components are clean and free from wetting fluid left by previous testing.<br /><br />
</li>
<!-- item #2 -->
<li><span class="redB">Prepare sample to be tested.</span>  Cut sample to fit in chamber, if necessary.  Make sure sample completely covers o-ring.  Use adapter plates, if necessary.<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #3 -->
<li><span class="redB">Select Group.</span>  The current group is listed on the main screen.  If this is the correct group, skip this step.  To change to a different group, click on the Group menu.  Choose an existing group (Select Group Ctrl+U) or make a new group (New Group Ctrl+N).<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item # 4-->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Execute</span> on the main Capwin menu, <span class="red">select <span class="bold">Autotest F2</span></span>.  The Autotest settings screen will open.<br />
	If the <span class="bold"></span>Test Type field is visible but does not indicate <span class="bold">Bubble Point Test - Automated Mode</span>, click on	<span class="bold">Test Type</span> to bring up the <span class="bold">Test Selection</span> box.<br />
	<span class="red">Select <span class="bold"></span><span class="bold">Bubble Point</span> and click on <span class="bold">Automatic Detection</span></span> under <span class="bold">Bubble Point Options</span>
.  Check the Show results at the end of test box if desired.  This option will display the Bubble Point diameter and pressure immediately following completion of test.<br />
	<span class="red">Click <span class="bold">OK</span></span> to return to the <span class="bold">Autotest</span> screen.<br /><br />
</li>
<!-- item #5 -->
<li>At the <span class="bold">Autotest</span> screen, <span class="red">enter information in the designated fields</span> by clicking on the field:
   <span class="red">Note:</span> Depending on which fields the supervisor has check-marked, not all fields may appear in Autotest.
   <span class="bold">Output File Name</span> - user designated<br />
   <span class="bold">End User</span> - user designated<br />
   <span class="bold">Test Reference</span> - user designated, eg: Bubble Point<br />
   <span class="bold">Sample ID</span> - user designated<br />
   <span class="bold">Lot Number</span> - user designated<br />
   <span class="bold" >Operator</span>- user designated, eg: the initials of person running test<br />
   <span class="bold" >Fluid</span>- the wetting fluid used to saturate the sample<br />
   <span class="bold">Surface Tension</span> - surface tension of the fluid, in dynes/cm .<br />
	eg: Porewick 16.0, Galwick 15.9, Silwick 20.1, Water 72.0.<br /><br />
</li>
<!-- item #6 -->
<li><span class="red">Place saturated sample in sample chamber or holder</span>, making sure sample seals against o-ring.<br />

If adapter plates are used,<span class="red"> place the screened adapter plate on the bottom of sample chamber</span>.  Align the plate on the three chamber pins.  Yellow chip pullers are provided to aid in putting in and taking out plates from the chamber.  Place sample on top of the bottom screened plate.  Make sure the o-ring of this bottom plate seals against the sample.  Place top adapter plate into chamber.<br />

<span class="red">Take spacing insert and place in chamber</span>. Avoid covering opening of insert when placing it in chamber, as this may create pressure, which will push wetting fluid from the pores of the sample and result in inaccurate measurements. The insert should sit no lower than the height of the sample chamber.  Screw on lid and hand-tighten.  Connect air hose from shroud to quick-connect fitting on lid.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #7 -->
<li><span class="red">Click on the <span class="bold">Start Test</span> button ALT+S</span>. The Autotest sequence will now begin.  If the <span class="bold">Hide Sample Load Prompts</span> option has been selected, the test will not require further user input and will proceed to the actual test.  Otherwise, a dialogue box will appear, instructing user to Load saturated sample, seal chamber.<br /><br /> </li>
<!-- item #8 -->
<li><span class="red">Click <span class="bold">OK</span></span> to start test.  This will bring up the <span class="bold">Current Test Status</span> screen.  A second dialogue box will appear, prompting user to press <span class="bold">OK</span> to start the test.<br /><br /> </li>
<!-- item #9 -->
<li>The Bubble Point test begins.  Air at a set flow rate is supplied to the sample chamber.  This results in a constant rate of pressure increase.  A calculated value of <span class="bold">(Flow Rate/Pressure Change)*Time</span>, the (F/P)*T factor, appears on screen.  The (F/P)*T factor grows larger as the rate of pressurization grows smaller.  Once the F/P*T factor is above the set F/P*T value, the bubble point pressure is recorded and the test ends.<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #10 -->
<li>The <span class="bold">Test Done</span> dialogue box will now appear.  <span class="redB">Click OK</span>.<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #11 -->
<li><span class="red">Remove the sample from chamber.  Clean chamber and components</span>
 to prepare for next test run. <br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #12 -->
<li>Test results may be viewed and analyzed using <span class="bold">CapRep</span>. To get to <span class="bold">CapRep</span> from the <span class="bold">Capwin</span>
 main menu. <span class="red">Go under <span class="bold">Report</span> and click on <span class="bold">Execute Report F4</span></span>.<br /><br /></li>
