<!-- item #1 -->
<li><span class="red">Prepare sample to be tested.</span>  Sample may need to be cut in order to fit and lie flat in the sample chamber.  The sample should be cut bigger than the o-ring in order to completely cover the o-ring and ensure proper sealing.  Samples smaller than the o-ring will require adapter plates.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #2 -->
<li><span class="red">Disconnect any hose attached to the sample chamber lid.</span>
  Unscrew and remove the sample chamber lid.  Take out the spacing insert and adapter plates (if present).  Check the o-rings for dryness, apply vacuum grease if needed. Make sure components are clean and free from wetting fluid left by previous testing.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #3 -->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Group</span> on the main Capwin menu, <span class="red">choose an existing group</span> by clicking on <span class="bold">Select Group</span> Ctrl+U <span class="red">or make a new group</span> by clicking on <span class="bold">New Group</span> Ctrl+N. A group contains the pressure units used and the Autotest setup for the last test ran using this group.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #4 -->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Execute</span> on the main Capwin menu,<span class="red"> select <span class="bold">Autotest F2</span></span>. The <span class="bold">Autotest</span> settings screen will open.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #5 -->
<li>If the <span class="bold">Test Type</span> field is visible but does not show <span class="bold">Capillary Flow Porometry -Wet up, Dry up</span>, click on <span class="bold">Test Type</span> to bring up the <span class="bold">Test Selection</span> box.<br />
Select <span class="redB">Capillary Flow Porometry</span> and click on <span class="bold">Wet Up/Dry Up</span> under <span class="redB">Capillary Flow Porometry Options</span>.  <br />
Check<span class="bold"> No Wait at Dry</span> for test to continue on to the Dry Up portion of test upon reaching the set maximum pressure or flow.  Otherwise, test will wait for user to press OK before starting on the Dry Up portion of test.  <br />
Check the <span class="redB">Show results at the end of test</span>
 box, if desired. This option will display the Bubble Point and Mean Flow Pore pressures and diameters immediately following completion of test.  <br />
<span class="red">Click <span class="redB">OK</span> to return to the <span class="redB">Autotest</span> screen.</span>
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #6 -->
<li>At the Autotest screen, <span class="red">enter information in the designated fields</span> by clicking on the field:<br />
   <span class="red">Note:</span> Depending on which fields the supervisor has selected to be shown, not all fields may appear in Autotest.<br />

<!-- item #7 -->
<li>
<span class="red">Place saturated sample in sample chamber, making sure sample seals against o-ring.</span><br />
If adapter plates are used, place the screened adapter plate on the bottom of sample chamber. The o-ring on the bottom plate should face upwards. Align the plate on the three chamber pins.  Yellow chip pullers are provided to aid in placement. Put in the saturated sample. <span class="red">Make sure sample fully covers the o-ring of the bottom plate in order to make a good seal.</span> Place top adapter plate into chamber with o-ring facing downward. The sample should now be completely sealed against the top and bottom o-rings of the adapter plates.

<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #8 -->
<li><span class="red">Take spacing insert and place into chamber.</span> Avoid covering opening of insert when placing it in chamber, as this may create pressure, which will push wetting fluid from the pores of the sample and result in inaccurate measurements. The bottom o-ring of the spacing insert should be in contact with the sample (or the adapter plate, if used). The insert should sit no lower than the height of the sample chamber. Screw on lid and hand tighten. Connect air hose from shroud to quick-connect fitting on lid.

<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #9 -->
<li><span class="red">Click on the <span class="redB">Start Test</span> button ALT+S.</span>  The Autotest sequence will now begin. If the <span class="bold">Hide Sample Load Prompts</span> option was selected, test will not require further user input and will proceed to the actual test.    Otherwise, a dialogue box will appear, instructing user to Load saturated sample, seal chamber.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #10 -->
<li>Click <span class="bold">OK</span>
 to start test. This will bring up the <span class="bold">Current Test Status</span>
 screen. A second dialogue box will appear, prompting user to <span class="red">press <span class="redB">OK</span> to start the test</span>.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #11 -->
<li>The Wet Up portion of the <span class="bold">Wet Up/Dry Up</span> test begins. The test will increase the pressure and measure the flow through and pressure drop across the saturated sample. The graph is plotted on the screen as test progresses. If <span class="bold">No</span> <span class="redB">Wait at Dry</span> was selected, test will "turn" and will go on to the Dry Up portion of the test upon reaching the set maximum pressure or flow. Otherwise, a prompt to <span class="red">Load sample, seal chamber</span> will appear when test reaches the end of the Wet Up portion of test.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #12 -->
<li>Test may proceed using the sample already in the chamber or with a <span class="red">new dry sample</span>. This is left up to supervisor discretion.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #13 -->
<li><span class="red">Click <span class="redB">OK</span> to proceed to Dry Up portion of test.</span>

<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #14 -->
<li>At the completion of the dry curve, the <span class="bold">Test Done</span> dialogue box will appear. Click <span class="bold">OK</span>.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #15 -->
<li><span class="red">Remove sample from chamber.</span> Clean chamber and components to prepare for next test run.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #16 -->
<li>Test results may be viewed and analyzed using <span class="bold">CapRep</span>. To access <span class="bold">CapRep</span> from the <span class="bold">Capwin</span>
 main menu, select <span class="bold">Report</span> and click on <span class="bold">Execute Report F4</span>.
