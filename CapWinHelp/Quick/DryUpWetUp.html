<!-- item #1 -->
<li><span class="redB">Prepare the sample to be tested.</span> The sample may need to be cut in order to fit and lie flat in the sample chamber.  The sample should be cut bigger than the o-ring in order to completely cover the o-ring and ensure proper sealing. Samples smaller than the o-ring will require adapter plates.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #2 -->
<li><span class="red">Disconnect the air hose attached to the sample chamber lid.</span>
 Unscrew and remove the lid. Take out the spacing insert and adapter plates (if provided). Check the o-rings for dryness, apply vacuum grease if needed. Make sure all components are clean and free from wetting fluid left by previous testing.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #3 -->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Group</span>
 on the main Capwin menu, choose an existing group by clicking on <span class="bold">Select Group</span> Ctrl+U <span class="red">or make a new group</span>
 by clicking on <span class="bold">New Group</span> Ctrl+N.<br />
	A group contains the pressure units used and the Autotest setup for the last test ran using this group.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #4 -->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Execute</span> on the main Capwin menu, <span class="red">select <span class="bold">Autotest F2</span></span>. The <span class="bold">Autotest</span> settings screen will open.<br />
<br /></li>
<!-- item #5 -->
<li>If the <span class="bold">Test Type</span>
 field is visible but does not show <span class="redB">Capillary Flow Porometry </span>
 <span class="bold">-Dry up, Wet up</span>, click on <span class="bold">Test Type</span> to bring up the <span class="bold">Test Selection</span> box. <br />
<span class="bold">Select Capillary Flow Porometry</span> and click on <span class="bold">Dry Up/Wet Up</span> under <span class="bold">Capillary Flow Porometry Options</span>
.  Check the <span class="bold">Show results at the end of test</span> box if desired.  This option will display the Bubble Point and Mean Flow Pore pressures and diameters immediately following completion of the test.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #6 -->
<li>At the Autotest screen, enter information in the designated fields by clicking on the field:<br />
<span class="redB">Note:</span> Depending on which fields the supervisor has selected to be shown, not all fields may appear in <span class="redB">Autotest</span>.<br />
<span class="bold">Output File Name</span> - user designated<br />
<span class="bold">End User</span> - user designated<br />
<span class="bold">Test Reference</span> - user designated, eg: Capillary Flow Porometry, or Dry Up/Wet Up<br />
<span class="bold">Sample ID</span> - user designated<br />
<span class="bold">Lot Number</span> - user designated<br />
<span class="bold">Operator</span> - user designated, eg: the initials of person running test<br />
<span class="bold">Fluid</span> - the wetting fluid used to saturate the sample during the Wet Up portion of the test.<br />
<span class="bold">Surface Tension</span> - surface tension of the fluid, in dynes/cm.<br />
eg: Porewick 19., Galwick 15.6, Silwick 20.1, Water 72.0.<br />
<span class="bold">Diameter</span> - diameter at which the sample is being tested, which is the inner diameter of the o-ring.<br />
<span class="bold">Thickness</span> - thickness of sample<br />
<span class="bold">*Cylindrical Length</span> - only required for samples tested in the radial direction<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #7 -->
<li><span class="redB">Place the sample into the sample chamber</span>, making sure the sample seals against the o-ring.<br />
<div class="indentQss">If adapter plates are used, <span class="red">place the screened adapter plate on the bottom of sample chamber</span>. Align the plate on the three chamber pins. Yellow chip pullers are provided to aid in putting in and taking out plates from the chamber. Place the sample on top of the screened plate. Make sure the o-ring of the bottom plate seals against the sample. Place the top adapter plate into chamber.</div>
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #8 -->
<li><span class="redB">Place the chamber insert in the chamber.</span> The insert should sit no lower than the height of the sample chamber. <span class="red">Screw on the lid and hand tighten.</span> Connect the air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the lid.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #9 -->
<li><span class="red">Click on the <span class="bold">Start Test</span> button ALT+S.</span>  The Autotest sequence will now begin.  If the <span class="bold">Hide Sample Load Prompts</span> option was selected, the test will not require further user input and will proceed to the actual test.  Otherwise, a dialogue box will appear, instructing the user to Load sample, seal chamber.<br />
<span class="red">Click <span class="bold">OK</span> to start the test.</span>  This will bring up the <span class="bold">Current Test Status</span> screen.  A second dialogue box will appear, prompting user to press <span class="bold"></span>OK to start the test.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #10 -->
<li>The dry portion of the <span class="bold">Dry Up/Wet Up</span> test begins. The test will increase the pressure and measure the flow through and pressure drop across the dry sample. The graph is plotted on the screen as test progresses.  At	the end of the dry curve, test will pause and wait for the user to saturate the sample.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #11 -->
<li>A dialogue box will appear, prompting the user to <span class="red">Load saturated sample, seal chamber.</span>  <br />
<span class="red">Saturate sample with wetting fluid.</span>  It is preferable to saturate the sample by unscrewing the lid and squirting wetting fluid onto the sample through the opening of the insert. This lessens the chance of the sample moving during testing. If the sample needs to be taken out of the chamber to saturate, check that the sample still covers the o-ring when it is placed back into the chamber.  Avoid covering the opening of the insert when <span class="red">replacing it back into the chamber</span>
, as this may create pressure, which may push wetting fluid from the pores of the sample and result in inaccurate measurements.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #12 -->
<li>Press <span class="redB">OK</span> after loading the sample.  A second dialogue box will appear.  Clicking <span class="bold">OK</span> the second time will start the wet portion of the test.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #13 -->
<li>At the completion of the wet curve, the <span class="bold">Test Done </span>
dialogue box will appear.  Click <span class="bold">OK</span>.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #14 -->
<li>Remove the sample from the chamber. <span class="red">Clean the chamber and all components to prepare for the next test run.</span>
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #15 -->
<li>Test results may be viewed and analyzed using <span class="bold">CapRep</span>. To get to <span class="bold">CapRep</span> from the <span class="bold">Capwin</span>
 main menu. <span class="red">Go under <span class="bold">Report</span> and click on <span class="bold">Execute Report F4</span></span>.<br /><br /></li>
