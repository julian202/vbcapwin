<!-- item #1 -->
<li><span class="red">Prepare sample to be tested.</span>  Sample may need to be cut in order to fit and lie flat in the sample chamber.  The sample should be cut bigger than the o-ring in order to completely cover the o-ring and ensure proper sealing.  Samples smaller than the o-ring will require adapter plates.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #2 -->
<li><span class="red">Disconnect any hose attached to the sample chamber lid.</span>
  Unscrew and remove the sample chamber lid.  Take out the spacing insert and adapter plates (if present).  Check the o-rings for dryness, apply vacuum grease if needed. Make sure components are clean and free from wetting fluid left by previous testing.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #3 -->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Group</span> on the main Capwin menu, <span class="red">choose an existing group</span> by clicking on <span class="bold">Select Group</span> Ctrl+U <span class="red">or make a new group</span> by clicking on <span class="bold">New Group</span> Ctrl+N. A group contains the pressure units used and the Autotest setup for the last test ran using this group.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #4 -->
<li>Under <span class="bold">Execute</span> on the main Capwin menu,<span class="red"> select <span class="bold">Autotest F2</span></span>. The <span class="bold">Autotest</span> settings screen will open.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #5 -->
<li>If the <span class="bold">Test Type</span> field is visible but does not show<span class="bold">Capillary Flow Porometry - Wet up, Dry down</span> , click on <span class="bold">Test Type</span><span class="bold">Test Selection</span> to bring up the  box.<br />
 <span class="red">Select <span class="redB">Capillary Flow Porometry</span></span> and click on<span class="bold"> Wet Up/Dry Down</span> under <span class="bold">Capillary Flow Porometry Options</span>.  <br />
Check <span class="bold">Stop Dry at Bubble Point for Dry Down</span> portion of test to end upon reaching the bubble point pressure.  If this option is not selected, the test will continue taking points on the Dry Down curve until it reaches the atmospheric pressure at which the test initially started.  <br />
Check the <span class="redB">Show results at the end of test</span> box, if desired.  This option will display the Bubble Point and Mean Flow Pore pressures and diameters immediately following completion of the test.  <br />
   <span class="red">Click <span class="bold">OK</span> to return to the <span class="bold">Autotest</span> screen.</span>
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #6 -->
<li>At the Autotest screen, <span class="red">enter information in the designated fields</span> by clicking on the field:<br />
   <span class="red">Note:</span> Depending on which fields the supervisor has selected to be shown, not all fields may appear in Autotest.<br />

<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #7 -->
<li><span class="redB">Place saturated sample in sample chamber</span>, making sure sample seals against o-ring.<br />
If adapter plates are used, place the screened adapter plate on the bottom of sample chamber.  The o-ring on the bottom plate should face upwards.  Align the plate on the three chamber pins.  Yellow chip pullers are provided to aid in placement of adapter plates.  Put in the saturated sample.  Make sure sample fully covers the o-ring of the bottom plate in order to make a good seal.  Place top adapter plate into chamber with o-ring facing downward.  <span class="red">Sample should now be completely sealed against the top and bottom o-rings of the adapter plates.</span>
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #8 -->
<li><span class="red">Place the sample chamber insert into the chamber.</span>
  Avoid covering the opening of the insert when placing it into the chamber, as this may create pressure which may force wetting fluid from the pores of the sample and result in inaccurate measurements.  The bottom o-ring of the chamber insert should be in contact with the sample (<span class="red">or the adapter plate, if used</span>).  The insert should sit no lower than the height of the sample chamber.  Screw on the lid and hand tighten.  Connect the air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the lid.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #9 -->
<li>Click on the Start Test button ALT+S.  The Autotest sequence will now begin.  If the Hide Sample Load Prompts option was selected, the test will not require further user input and will proceed to the actual test.  Otherwise, a dialogue box will appear, instructing the user to Load saturated sample, seal chamber.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #10 -->
<li>Click <span class="bold">OK</span> to start test.  This will bring up the <span class="bold">Current Test Status</span> screen.  A second dialogue box will appear, prompting user to press <span class="bold">OK</span> to start the test.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #11 -->
<li>The <span class="bold">Wet Up</span> portion of the <span class="redB">Wet Up/Dry Down</span> test begins.  The test will increase the pressure and measure the flow through and pressure drop across the saturated sample.  The graph is plotted on the screen as test progresses.  Upon reaching the set maximum pressure or flow, the test will "turn" and continue to the <span class="redB">Dry Down</span>
 portion of the test.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #12 -->
<li>At the completion of the dry curve, the <span class="bold">Test Done</span> dialogue box will appear.  Click <span class="bold">OK</span>.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #13 -->
<li><span class="red">Remove the sample from the chamber.</span>  Clean the chamber and all components to prepare for the next test run.
<br /><br /></li>
<!-- item #14 -->
<li>Test results may be viewed and analyzed using <span class="bold">CapRep</span>. To access <span class="bold">CapRep</span> from the <span class="bold">Capwin</span>
 main menu, select <span class="bold">Report</span> and click on <span class="bold">Execute Report F4</span>.
