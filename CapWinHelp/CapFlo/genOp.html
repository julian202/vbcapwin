<h3>Capillary Flow Porometry </h3>
<hr />
<h4>General Operation</h4>
<p>The Capillary Flow Porometry test determines the mean flow pore size, bubble point, cumulative flow, and pore size distribution.</p>
<p>There are five modes for the porometry tests:</p>
<ol>
<li>wet-up/dry-down: pressure increases during the wet curve which is followed by the dry curve in which the pressure decreases.</li>
<li>wet-up/dry-up: pressure increases in both the wet and dry curves; wet curve is run first.</li>
<li>dry-up/wet-up: dry curve is run first; pressure increases in both curves</li>
<li>wet-up/linear-dry (calc dry): a linear dry plot is extrapolated from wet phase data </li>
</ol>
<p>The user should experiment with the five modes to find the one that gives the best results for the sample being tested. "Wet" and "dry" refer to the state of the sample. "Up" and "down" refer to the pressure.</p>
<p>Mode <strong>(3)</strong>, dry-up/wet-up, is the most commonly used and usually the most reliable of the five modes. Because the dry phase is run before the wet phase, it usually yields the best dry data. In cases where samples can be deformed by the unrestricted dry flow in the dry-up/wet-up mode, mode <strong>(1)</strong> or <strong>(2)</strong> may produce more reliable results. In some cases, time can be saved by using mode <strong>(1)</strong> &amp; <strong>(4)</strong>. Mode <strong>(4)</strong> does not run a dry phase. It extrapolates a linear dry plot from the wet phase data. Mode <strong>(1)</strong> saves time by the option of ending the dry phase at the bubble point.</p>

<p>After a dry sample is installed in the sample chamber and the user has begun the test, the motorized metering valve V2 is opened in increments. The regulator opening is increased, increasing the flow into the system, causing the pressure and the flow rate through the sample to increase. Data points are taken at each equilibrium point as long as the pressure and flow rates are increasing. As the pressure increases, smaller and smaller pores are opened in the sample.</p>
<p>When either maximum flow rate or maximum pressure is reached, the regulator resets itself at zero, the metering valve <strong>V2</strong> closes and the user is prompted to remove the sample, saturate it, and replace it in the sample chamber. When the test is continued, the bubble point is taken by recording the wet curve.</p>
