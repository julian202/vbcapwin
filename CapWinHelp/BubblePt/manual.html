<h3>Manual Mode</h3>
<hr />
<p>The manual bubble point test is similar to the automated test except for the way in which the bubble point is taken.</p>
<p>The pressure regulator is incremented until you visually confirm the first constant flow of bubbles and the select a menu option BUBBLE to accept the current pressure and flow values as the bubble point.</p>
<p>When testing a wet sample, it is often helpful to drip 1-2 ml of fluid into the top of the sample chamber. This allows the flow through the sample to be seen through the clear walls of the chamber. This extra fluid does not affect the test procedure. Be careful, however, of the amount of fluid applied: too much fluid requires more pressure to obtain inaccurate flow and results.</p>
<p>When testing wet thin samples with the adapter plates in the sample chamber, it is very difficult to visually determine the bubble point. To see bubbles, a large amount of fluid needs to be added to the top of the sample to cover the thickness of the top adapter plate. Depending on the sample, this amount of liquid might give inaccurate bubble point results. It is best not to add liquid to the sample when using adapter plates.</p>
