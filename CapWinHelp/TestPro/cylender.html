<p>Cylindrical samples that are at least 1.875" ID, less than 2.5" OD and less than .75" in height can be tested in the standard sample chamber.</p>
<p>Place a disc of flexible silicon rubber with a hole in its center in the bottom of the chamber. The hole admits air into the cylindrical sample.</p>
<p>Place the cylindrical sample on the silicon rubber. Be sure the sample chamber O ring is within the inside diameter of the cylindrical sample.</p>
<p>Place a solid disk of flexible silicon rubber on top of the cylindrical sample. This disk forces the air from within the sample to pass through the sample.</p>
<p>Place a vented spacer (or two) on top of the silicon disk. The vented spacer is a rigid acrylic disc with slots cut from the edge to a center hole. This disc vents the air from the sample chamber (after it has passed through the sample) into the center hole of the spacing insert. From there, the air is vented to atmosphere.</p>
