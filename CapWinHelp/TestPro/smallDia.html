<h3>Small Diameter Samples </h3>
<hr />
<img class="right" src="../images/testpro/small.jpg" width="250" height="178" alt="cross section of a small sample being positioned between two adapter plates." />
<p>The small-sample adapter plates for small diameter samples consist of thin disks with holes for the alignment pins and a smaller diameter sample area.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the first adapter plate in the sample chamber with the small O ring facing upward.</li>
<li>Place sample over the small O ring.</li>
<li>Install the second adapter plate in the chamber with the small O ring towards the sample.</li>
<li>Install the spacing insert. Be careful not to cover the top opening with the palm when pressing it down onto the sample. Doing so can cause trapped air to blow fluid out of the pores of wet samples.</li>
<li>Screw the cap onto the chamber. Tighten it to the point where the O ring on top of the spacing insert is compressed against the chamber cap.</li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Caution: Over-tightening the cap can cause the cap and spacing insert to jam. If this happens, the sample chamber must be replaced. Over-tightening may also damage the sample. Also, for 500 PSI instruments, do not use plastic adapter plates. They may rupture at high pressure. Stainless steel adapter plates are provided.</font></p>

<h3>Large Diameter Samples</h3>
<hr />
<p>Samples too large to fit in the chamber need to be fitted into custom chambers. External chambers are connected to the sample chamber via a quick-connect fitting provided by an alternate sample chamber cover provided with the instrument. </p>
