<h4>Advanced Settings</h4>
<p>Allows user to change what options are available in Supervisor Mode. If the <strong>Use Advanced Settings Only</strong> setting in the Preferences window is checked, then the software will take you right to the Autotest Main Screen with all of its options available. If not, the user will be taken to the screen below first that displays only some of the options available on the Advanced Setting Autotest screen. <strong>The Show Advanced Settings</strong> button must be clicked in order to get to the Advanced Setting Autotest screen</p>

<p><img src="../images/execute/start.jpg" width="105" height="25" alt="Start button" border="0" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="10" />Starts the automated test using the displayed options. When the <strong>Start Test</strong> button is clicked, the system checks the settings for validity. If there are any invalid entries, they must be corrected before the test begins. The system then initializes the positions</p>
<p>of all of the valves, internal mechanical components, and metering devices and begins the test. The next screen that will appear is the Current Test Status screen that shows a graph of the progress of the test. (For multi-chamber machines, this button will only appear after the last chamber selected has been set up. Otherwise, the button will be labeled NEXT UNIT and is used to setup the test for the next chamber selected. )</p>
<p>If the porometer being used has the Compression feature available, a box asking for the desired compressive force will appear before the test is begun. The user can either enter a pressure directly or can select a calculated pressure based on the area of the sample and the desired applied force. If zero is entered, no compressive pressure will be applied. The pressure selected should take into account the dimensions of the sample and the diameter of the piston itself. Once the settings have been entered, the user is brought to the regular test set-up screen and the compression piston will function on its own. (For more information on the Compression feature, please refer to the section regarding <a href="../Principles/Calc.html#poreSize">Pore Size Distribution</a>.)</p>

<h5>Tortuosity Factor &amp; Minimum and Maximum Pressure</h5>
<p><img id="right" src="../images/execute/tort.jpg" width="303" height="90" alt="Tortuosity an min, max pressure input and decision boxes" /></p>
<p>Also known as the "capillary constant," it is used by the machine (along with the pressure and surface tension measured in the test) to calculate the diameter of a pore. The default value has been experimentally obtained and is 0.715 for most materials. </p>
<p>The value set for minimum pressure defines the pressure at which the test will begin. The maximum pressure value determines the highest pressure that will be reached during the test (usually this will be the end of the test).</p>
