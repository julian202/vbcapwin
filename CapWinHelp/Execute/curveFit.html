<h4>
Using Automated Curve Fitting
</h4>
<p>Capwin now offers the ability to automatically curve-fit a data file as it is created at the end of a test. This option is located in the Preferences window under the Tests tab:</p>
<img src="../images/execute/pref01.jpg" width="370" height="354" alt="Prefrences form with the focus on the Tests tab." vspace="10" hspace="30" />
<p>Check the box next to <strong>Automatically curve-fit data file at end of test</strong> to turn this feature on.</p>
<p>Next, click the <strong>Curve Fit</strong> tab. This will allow you to change the settings for curve fitting:</p>
<img src="../images/execute/pref02.jpg" width="370" height="354" alt="Preferences page displayed with the focus on the curve fit tab." vspace="10" hspace="30" />
<p>1.	Enter the number of data points used in the fitting function (3 to 10 points).</p>
<p>2.	Enter the maximum percentage error. This defines how much deviation from the fitted curve a specific data point may have.</p>
<p>3.	Enter the maximum pressure difference between adjacent data points. This determines whether additional data points will be interpolated into the file.</p>
<p>When finished, click Save to save the test options.</p>
<p>Until the automatic curve fit is turned off, each test run on the porometer system will result in a curve-fitted data file.</p>
<p class="red">WARNING: If a data file is automatically curve-fitted, the flow and pressure values recorded may not correctly reflect the actual values measured during the test. The curve-fitted data file is a smoothed-out representation of the data. The original values are not preserved.</p>
