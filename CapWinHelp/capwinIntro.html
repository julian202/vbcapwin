<h3>Introduction to the CapWin Program</h3>
<hr />
<p> The CapWin Software System for Windows was developed to control several instruments:  the Capillary Flow Porometer, the Perm-Porometer, and the Complete Filter Analyzer.  Depending on the instrument in use, different options will be available in the software.</p>

<p>The CapWin Software allows the instrument to be controlled either manually or automatically.  Users can customize the parameters used to run automated tests, and edit data files.  Tests are performed with a minimal amount of user interaction, and the data attained can be viewed using a variety of reporting options, but the recommended method is to use the CapRep program provided by PMI.
