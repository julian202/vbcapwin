<p>This procedure is designed to test the ability of a sample to withstand the application of a set pressure over a period of time. Data from this analysis can be used as a general permeability value.</p>
<p>After a sample is installed in the chamber, the software will ask for a holding pressure. This value will constitute the set pressure across the sample.</p>
<p>The user will then be asked to enter a hold time, which is the amount of time the test will be run. The test will attempt to take one hundred data points during this time, which will take about one minute. If the overall entered time duration is less that one minute, fewer data points will be taken.</p>

<p>At the end test, the <span class="bold">Regulator</span> zeroes itself and the <span class="bold">Drain Valve</span> opens to release all pressure within the system.</p>
