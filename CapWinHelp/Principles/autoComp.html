<h4>Automated Compression Feature</h4>
<p>Under compression settings, a sample is tested under a constant compressive force. This force is applied by a pneumatic piston (supplied by an external compressed air supply) which itself is controlled by pneumatic regulator. The force of the piston is equal to the force applied to the sample.</p>
<p>This option is available for any test that can be started from the <span class="bold">Auto Test</span> screen and can be controlled either manually or automatically. For manual control, the user may go to the <span class="bold">Manual Control</span> screen located in the <span class="bold">Execute</span> menu. On the manual control screen, the compression pressure may be manipulated by clicking on the regulator and setting the increment values. The compression pressure itself is displayed in the last line of the gauge readouts in the upper left hand corner of the screen. </p>
<p>The compression feature comes with a special non-threaded lid and a spacer to be placed on top of the lid (so that piston does not interfere with the fitting on the lid when it is lowered). Otherwise, setting up the sample is the same as the rest of the tests.</p>
