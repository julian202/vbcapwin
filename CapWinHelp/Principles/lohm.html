<h4>Lohm table </h4>
<p>The lohm correction factor is used to compensate for pressure drop in the porometer system. Applied pressures during a test are measured using an electronic pressure regulator. However, the pressure measured at the transducer may not be exactly the same as the actual pressure drop across the sample: pressure drop will vary with the internal arrangement of transducers and piping or tubing, air flow through the system, and properties of the sample itself.</p>
<p>To eliminate as much error as possible, the lohm calculation is used to correct test data as pressure and flow are measured in the system. The lohm calibration, performed on an empty sample chamber, measures the pressure change at the transducer at different air flow rates, with the assumption that the pressure drop across the (absent) sample is zero. The table of calculated values as a function of flow rate is used as a lookup function during a test on a real sample.</p>
