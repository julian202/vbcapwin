<h4>Explanation of Flow Transducer Counts</h4>
<p>The output of a flow transducer to the computer is in counts. The full range of the transducer is divided into 60,000 counts. To determine a flow reading, the computer performs the following calculation:</p>
<p class="indent">	(Full range transducer flow / 60,000 counts) * transducer output in counts.</p>
<p>example:<br />
A transducer with a full range of 0 to 5000 cc/min has a low range that is 2/5ths of its full range. Therefore, a 0 to 5000 cc/min transducer has a low range of 0 to 2000 cc/min. The low range output is also divided into 60,000 counts.

</p>
<p>In the low range, 1 count equals 2000 / 60,000 or 0.1 cc/min. Therefore, the default of 50 counts would be 5 cc/min.</p>
<p>Combining the above steps into a single calculation yields:</p>
<p class="indent">(2 * 5000 cc/min * 50 counts) / (5 * 60,000 counts) = 5 cc/min.</p>
