[88] Using an XML declaration, although strongly encouraged
by the XHTML recommendation, may cause problems by causing
browsers, such as Internet Explorer 6.0, to trigger "quirks"
mode rendering. This mode causes non-standards complaint
rendering. Because of this, you may want to consider
removing the XML declaration.

[111] Tip - A good title is very important. Use many
keywords in your title tag but make it readable. This is
good for search engine rankings and when the page is
bookmarked. Example: <title>Download CSE HTML Validator -

  42: <h5>Mean Flow Pore Size</h5>
  43: <p>A saturated sample will pass air when the applied pressure exceeds the capillary attraction of the fluid in the pores, allowing flow to pass through. Smaller pores have a higher capillary attraction than larger pores. Therefore, smaller pores open at higher pressures.</p>
  44: <p>By comparing the gas flow rates of a wet and dry sample at the same pressures, the percentage of flow passing through the pores larger than or equal to the specified size may be calculated from the pressure-size relationship. By increasing pressure in small steps, it is possible to determine by the flow contribution of very small pore size increments.</p>
  45: <p>The pressure at which wet flow is one-half the dry flow is used to calculate the mean flow pore size using equation [1] on page 141, Maximum Pore Size</p>

  81: <h5>Envelope Surface Area</h5>
  82: <p>The Envelope Surface Area test is used to find the surface area of pores that allow flow through. The surface area of these pores completely envelopes the sample material, explaining the name of the test. When an ESA test is run, pressure of the system will be gradually increased and the change in through-flow and the resulting pressure drop are measured. Surface area is calculated from flow rate, pressure and the physical characteristics of the particular sample and gas being used by plugging in these data values into the Kozeny Carman equation shown below:</p>
  83: <div class="imag">
  84: <img src="../images/princip/envel.jpg" width="362" height="220" alt="Envelope surface area formula" /></div>
  85: <p>Flow rate, differential pressure, average pressure, thickness of sample and cross-sectional area can be measured either manually or by the porometer. Density and Viscosity must be obtained from appropriate tables and the porosity is calculated from the true density (&rho;t) and the bulk density (&rho;b) of the sample using the following equation:</p>

  90: <h5>Average Particle Size and Fiber Diameter form ESA Calculations</h5>
  91: <p>In the Envelope Surface Area test, the surface area per unit mass (Sm) and the density of the particles (&rho;p) is calculated. From these two values, the average particle size (Dp) of a powder sample can be obtained if it can be assumed that all particles of the sample are spherical and are the same size. If you are able to assume that the fibers of the sample being used (should be cylindrical) have the same diameter and length, you can find the average fiber diameter (Df),using the true density of the fiber (&rho;f). The following two equations are used to find Dp and Df respectively:</p>
  92: <p>Average Particle Size: Dp= 6/(Sm*&rho;p)</p>
  93: <p>Average Fiber Diameter: Df= 4/(Sm* &rho;f).</p>

[CSE] Comment number 1:
This program can help you make your web pages more
accessible. An accessible page is one that more individuals
can use, such as individuals who are blind or deaf. It can
also increase the usefulness of your web page for
individuals who browse the web using slower devices like
older computers or wireless devices like cell phones and
PDAs. An accessible web site makes good business sense (and
possibly good legal sense as well). You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

Kozeny (1x), reanges (1x), thier (1x), ESA (2x), Darcy's

[111] Tip - Do not use hidden text, small text, comments,
popular but unrelated words, etc. to try to 'cheat' to gain
better search engine rankings. This is dishonest and some
search engines may lower a page's rank for trying to
'cheat'.

[CSE] Comment number 5:
[8] <meta name="description" content="(actual description)"
/> should be used in the "head" section to provide a brief
description of what is contained on this page. This
information is used by many search engines when indexing a
site. If you are using HTML Validator's integrated editor,
then you can add this from the Tags menu and/or from the Tag
Inserter.

[CSE] Comment number 6:
[8] <meta name="keywords" content="(actual keyword list)" />
should be used in the "head" section to provide a list of
keywords that are relevent to this page. This information is
used by many search engines when indexing a site. If you are
using HTML Validator's integrated editor, then you can add
this from the Tags menu and/or from the Tag Inserter.

[CSE] Comment number 7:
An ICRA label (a rating "meta" tag) was not found in the
"head" section of this document. Browsers that are enabled
with this rating system may not display documents that have
not been labelled. If you have labelled this document by
rating the section (directory) in which it is found, or if
your site is a personal web space on a large Internet
Service Provider, it is still recommended that you include
the rating "meta" tag on all of your pages for performance
reasons. For more information, please visit
http://www.icra.org/.

[CSE] Comment number 8:
Although not normally necessary, you may want to include a
"meta" tag similar to the following in the "head" section of
your document: <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
content="text/html; charset=us-ascii" />

[CSE] Comment number 9:
[10] CSE HTML Validator Std/Pro allows you to disable
certain messages (like this example message) and groups of
related messages by disabling flags. For instance, the [10]
at the beginning of this message indicates that you can
disable this message by disabling validator flag 10. If you
are using HTML Validator's integrated editor, then you can
simply use your mouse on this message to open the context
menu (usually done by right-clicking the mouse on this
message) and select 'Disable Flag 10' to disable this
message. For more information about disabling messages,
please look at the Configuration section in the
documentation.

[CSE] Comment number 10:
CSE HTML Validator Std/Pro allows you to disable many
messages on an individual basis without using flags. For
instance, you can disable this message by using HTML
Validator's integrated editor to open the context menu for
this message (usually done by right-clicking the mouse on
this message) and selecting 'Options for this
Message->Disable Message' to disable this message. For more
information about disabling messages, please look at the
Configuration section in the documentation.
