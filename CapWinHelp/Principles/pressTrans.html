<h4>Explanation of Pressure Transducer Counts</h4>
<p>The output of a pressure transducer to the computer is in counts. The full range of the transducer is divided into 60,000 counts. To determine a pressure reading, the computer performs the following calculation:</p>
<p class="indent">(Full range transducer pressure / 60,000 counts) * transducer output in counts</p>
<p>example:<br />
A transducer with a full range of 0 to 250 torr differential equals a full range of 0 to 4.8355 psig.
</p>
<p>The transducer's low range is 1/5th of its full range. Therefore, a 250 torr transducer has a low range of 0 to 50 torr differential which equals 0 to 0.9671 psig. The low range output is also divided into 60,000 counts.</p>
