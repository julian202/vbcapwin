<h3>Group Menu</h3>
<hr />
<p>Groups are used to simplify the automated testing procedure. Selecting a group loads a pre-set auto test setup, which prevents the user from having to change numerous settings for each type of test. The CapWin Software System uses "groups" as a means of saving multiple auto test-options setups. Groups may be used in several ways to organize the testing process. The following example uses groups to organize tests by sample lot number. Other examples of grouping tests are by customer, by type-of-test, by sample type, by test technician, by month, etc. The object is to define a group according to the parameters you design for it. The group organization works best if the same set of parameters is used for all samples in the group.</p>
