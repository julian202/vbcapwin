<p>When the software is in Supervisor Mode, all of the features of the software are accessible. When it is not in this mode, the software only displays User level features (not including Modify and Calibrate Menus and limiting the options of the other menus).</p>
<p>A third mode, QC Mode, is used when a specific test is being conducted a numerous amount of times, by more than one user. In this mode, only the supervisor can change the parameters, or only allows the user a limited amount of options to change</p>
<p>The supervisor can set a password to restrict switching between the Supervisor and User/QC modes. To do this, select Change Supervisor Password and type in any combination of numbers and letters. </p>
