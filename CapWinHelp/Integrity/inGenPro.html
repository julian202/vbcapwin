<p>The Integrity Flow Meter is an optional accessory to the Capillary Flow Porometer. There should be a connector labeled "Integrity Test" if this option is already installed.</p>
<p>In the Integrity Test, the gas flow through the sample is routed into the integrity flow transducer through the quick-connect fitting in the shroud panel behind the sample chamber. Connect the output from the chamber cap to the Integrity Test fitting using the supplied hose.</p>
<p>In contrast to other permeability testing methods, the Integrity Test takes post-sample flow measurements at various pressures, whereas all other tests measure pre-sample flow. Results of this test can be used for diffusionary studies below the bubble point or for general low-permeability testing</p>
<p>The Integrity Test uses a saturated sample. It increases the pressure slowly and records the flow that penetrates the sample. At pressures below the bubble point, flow will be generated because of simple diffusion through the sample. The flow rate will go up fairly linearly as the pressure is increased. When the pressure reaches the bubble point, the flow will increase quite quickly, until it reaches the maximum flow of the integrity test flow meter, which ends the test.</p>
