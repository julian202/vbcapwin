<h3>Thin Samples </h3>
<hr />
<p>For very thin samples where stretching and tearing is a problem, the following method of mounting is recommended.</p>
<img class="right" src="../images/TestPro/thin.jpg" width="250" height="175" alt="Cross section of the sample chamber with a thin sample." />
<p>The sample is placed in the bottom of the sample chamber. It is covered by a thin screen that has pores larger than those in the sample. One of the inserts used to test small-diameter samples is inverted and placed on top of the screen without its O rings. The large spacing insert is then placed in the chamber sealing against the thin insert, as is normally done.</p>
<p>The only restriction on the sample's support is that it should have pores larger than those in the sample so that the support does <u>NOT</u> cause any flow restriction which could result in erroneous data.</p>
