<h3>Sample Orientation</h3>
<hr />
<p>Depending on the sample, conflicting results may result from orienting the sample differently. Normally, samples are laid flat against the bottom of the chamber sandwiched between the O rings. Some samples, however, cannot be situated this way due to their size or shape. The most reliable results are obtained when a sample is tested while in a position similar to that of its intended use.</p>
<p>For example: A hollow, cylindrical sample can be tested by slicing the sample and laying it flat on the O rings in the chamber. The results from this test may be inaccurate due to the constriction of pores on the outer surface (the surface that would normally be circular). Better results might be achieved by mounting the sample <strong>outside</strong> the sample chamber: the alternate sample chamber cover equipped with a quick-connect fitting is provided for such purposes. One end of the porous cylinder sample can be sealed with a non-porous plug. The opposite end can be suspended from a piece of tubing connected to the quick-connect fitting on the alternate chamber cover.</p>
