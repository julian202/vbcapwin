<h3>Using Water as the Wetting Fluid</h3>
<hr />
<p>Problems can occur when running bubble point tests with water or liquids with similar properties to water. It is recommended that tests be run with Galwick or Silwick for best results.</p>
<p>These problems occur most often with thin samples that contain a small volume of liquid and in very permeable samples. It will also happen in tests run over a long duration of time.</p>
<p>Before the bubble point is reached, there is no flow through the sample, so the fluid is unlikely to evaporate. After the bubble point is reached, there is increased flow through the large pores in the sample. This flow can be thought of as an increase in the amount of air passing by the fluid still trapped in smaller pores. This will cause the rate of evaporation to increase.</p>
<p>If the fluid has a high vapor pressure and the flow by the fluid is high enough, the majority of the fluid will evaporate from the pores before being forced out by the pressure.</p>
<p>This creates a rate of flow through the sample that would not normally be expected until the pressure had forced the fluid out. This leads to the data showing pores that are larger than they should be since the program will view the increased flow as the fluid being forced out instead of evaporating.</p>
<p>Alcohol, which has a vapor pressure higher than water, is even more likely to have this problem and is not recommended for testing. Galwick or Silwick, on the other hand, has an extremely low vapor pressure and is almost totally immune to this problem.</p>
