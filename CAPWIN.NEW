What's New in the CAPWIN Software:

6.71.87) 11-29-05ecjc
 1)Made a modification for Pella that will allow the supervisors to dictate if a user
    can alter a specified parameter in the elevated liquid permiability test. This is done
    by adding a check box to the got value form which is visible only in the supervisors mode
    and when checked the user will be prompted to provide this information befor the test is
    run.

 2) Liquid permeability maximum pressure parameter now saved properly. (rvw 12-9-05)

 3) New parameter for elevated pressure liquid permeability test -
    lperm_initializeRegulatorPressure, defaults to 0.5 PSI.

 4) New parameter for elevated pressure liquid permeability test -
    lperm_regulatorIncrementSteps, defaults to 1.

 5) Elevated pressure liquid permeability no longer sets the temperature to zero at
    the beginning of the test.

6.71.86) 11-18-05 rvw
 1) Fixed problem where some incorrect flow readings could be put into the data file
    right after a pressure regulator switch on a low flow sample if the
    reg2_high_flow_switch_count parameter was too low so the program needed to increment
    the regulator more to get back to the pressure of the last data point.

6.71.85) 10-31-05 ecjc
 1) Modified the select Gas and Liquid form so that the program could call a single
    form for the purpose of creating and modifing liquids and gases. This form gives the user
    the ability to pick a gass or liquid from a drop down box and alter the surface tenseion
    or the viscosity or add a new gas or liquid. these are stored in an external textfile
    in the executable path.

6.71.84) 10-26-05 rvw
 1) Valve 3 is now closed during liquid permeability tests when valve 23 is present.
    Also valve 3 doesn't open when you resume from hold during liquid permeability tests
    for liquid perm only machines.
    Also fixed autofill routine so really slow fills will properly wait longer if the
    penetrometer is still going up.

6.71.83) 9-15-05 rvw final 9-27-05
 1) For I/P regulator machines (all current machines) regulator now has the option of
    starting at the SHFP instead of SBPP before opening valve 2 at the start of the dry
    curve or after the bubble point.  This helps with very low flow samples.  This may
    make high flow samples take more data points at really low pressures and flows.  The
    new configuration parameter "first_flow_starting_point_percent" defaults to 100,
    which uses the SBPP and will result in no change in the way the test starts.  To start
    the regulator at a lower point (to take more low pressure data) lower this parameter
    to 10, which uses the SHFP.  This only works on IP Regulator systems (version 7 or 8).
    SBPP is the regulator position that allows the flow controller to reach 100% of full
    scale.  SHFP is the regulator position that allows the flow controller to reach 10%
    of full scale.  You could set a value in between 10 and 100.  You may also be able to
    set a value lower than 10 or greater than 100.

 2) For version 7 and higher, if the feature number designates an integrity flow meter,
    you can have the integrity flow meter less than the low flow meter.  (The integrity
    flow meter range is used in place of the low range of the low flow meter, and this
    used to be the only determination that there was an integrity flow meter.)

6.71.82) 8-25-05 rvw modifications in Japan after delivery of 81 to customer
 1) Single pressure gas permeability now saves temperature data (for porometers
    with temperature capability).

6.71.81) 8-18-05 rvw final 8-24-05 in Japan for delivery to customer
 1) liquid_lohm is now used properly to correct for pressure drop based on
    liquid flow rate during liquid permeability tests
 2) Improved pressure control for Ambient liquid test for lowered penetrometers
 3) Ambient liquid test now correctly records temperature for recirulation machines
 4) Improved pressure control for Elevated liquid test
 5) Improved control of valve 12 (liquid chamber isolation) so it doesn't open
    when it shouldn't on recirculation machines to keep the chamber isolated while
    the penetrometer is filling.
 6) Fixed curve fit problem with data files with two temperature values
 7) Name of pressure list is now stored in the extended header of data files (for
    those that are run using the pressure list, which are only gas or liquid permeability)

6.71.80) 7-21-05 rvw, final 8-18-05
 1) Regulator calibration on liquid perm machines now closes valve 4 and doesn't ask you to seal
    the sample chamber.
 2) Max Liquid Flow test now saves better data into text file (for debugging purposes) and also
    works better with dual regulator systems.
 3) You can now go from partial recirculate to full test running, bypassing the full recirculation
    mode.  This is for samples that are already pre-loaded and where you don't want any flow through
    the sample until the actual test starts.
 4) Max Liquid Flow test now calculates a lohm value for the liquid flow.  This is stored in the
    capwin.ini file as "liquid_lohm", which defaults to 0 to signify no resistance to liquid flow.
 5) F/PT value for no change (or drop) in pressure changed from 99999 to 9999999 to make it work
    better with high flow machine that can have actual F/PT values of 100000

6.71.79) 7-19-05 rvw
  1) Lohm calibration on dual regulator systems now uses parameter "reg2_high_flow_switch_count"
     when it switches over.  Improved switchover mechanism.

6.71.78) 7-11-05 rvw, final 7-14-05
  1) Maximum liquid flow test now runs at slightly above 1 PSI differential air pressure instead
     of ambient pressure.  This allows systems with lowered penetrometers to run this calibration.
     During the calibration test, MAXLQFLOW.TXT is created to store intermediate values for use in
     debugging the new lohm calculation for liquid flow.
  2) Multi-chamber systems now have support for manual multi chamber, which means that the chamber
     selection is done by the user manually switching the supply hose.  The only purpose of this
     so far is to have multiple chambers with microflow, where the chamber isolation valves are now
     used as inlet selector valves for the microflow pressure gauge.  The microflow calibration needs
     to know which chamber is being used for the calibration.  Chamber volume and microflow volume
     are now stored in an array indexed off of the chamber that is being manually selected.  The
     chamber selector now knows that only one chamber can be selected for this type of machine.
  3) New liquid drain valve (23) now works properly for recirculation machines.
  4) Bubbler valve now opens after bubble point and before start of wet or dry curve.  It will work
     for gas permeability test too.  It should stay open at end of "wet up/dry down" test, but this
     is not tested as this type of test is not normally recommended.

6.71.77) 7-6-05 rvw, final version 7-7-05
  1) Added support for cyclic compression on systems with door switches.  Previously, this would
     only work if there was no safety feature or on autopiston systems which always have door
     switches but which do not have automated regulators.
  2) Added support for setting any valve command letter for the multi chamber isolation valves.
     This defaults to a string of "abcdefghij", which stands for normal isolation valves 1 through 10.
     For special cases where these valve mappings are already used by other special valves, such
     as a multi-chamber microflow system, this can be changed in the configuration file.
  3) Use of the bubbler is now optional.  If the bubbler is enabled in the configuration file,
     you now have to turn it on in the preferences form or it won't be used during the test.

6.71.76) 6-17-05 rvw, final version 7-6-05
  1) New valve 23 is now supported in liquid permeability tests.  It will open to drain out
     excess liquid from the penetrometer at the beginning of the test instead of pressurizing
     the penetrometer to force the excess fluid through the sample.
  2) New valve 25 replaces dual use of valve 4 for bubbler.  Disables valve 22 (which was only
     used on Ballard).  New configuration parameter "v22_exists", which defaults to "N".
  3) Better support for dual regulator machines where the low pressure regulator can't get to
     full flow rate.  New configuration parameter "reg2_high_flow_switch_count", which defaults
     to 300.  This is the regulator count value that is used as a starting point when we switch
     to the second regulator due to not being able to reach a high flow rate on regulator 1.
  4) During lohm calibration, if the flow rate ever goes off scale, it won't record a lohm value
     for that flow rate.  It had been doing this, and this could cause an incorrect lohm value at
     the end of the lohm table.
  5) After switchover to second regulator during lohm calibration, the rate of increase of the
     regulator is slowed while hunting for the starting point so it doesn't overshoot as much due to
     a slowly reacting system.

6.71.75) 6-14-05 rvw, ecjc, MJLC final version 6-17-05
  1) Fixed integrity test so that if the flow meter ever gets switched from integrity to
     something else (such as when you go to manual control and click on the low flow meter)
     it will get switched back.
  2) Added several lines of code to the CAPFLOW.BAS and the CAPMAIN.frm that enable the program
     to pull up the new help system in the usersdefault browser. The material in the help system
     has also been updated to reflect the newest version of the users manual. - ecjc
  3) New optional bubble point time log (also works with hydrohead) creates a log file with
     pressure, flow, and time values that can be imported into a spreadsheet.
  4) MJLC: Updated lanugage files

6.71.74) 5-16-05 rvw, MJLC - final on 6-1-05
  1) Added support for dual stage compression (uses new valve 24, "COMPRESSION=D")
  2) This also adds new variables pretreat_flow and pretreat_time, both defaulting to 0 to disable
     them.  Flow is in cc/min, time is in seconds.
  3) Cleaned up lohm calculations.  It will now properly turn a test when the lohm ratio gets too
     low again. (It wasn't doing this since we changed lohm functions and changed the meanings of
     some of the internal variables.)
  4) MJLC: Fixed a problem encountered when switching from a test using a pressure step list to one without:
     points for the list would be interpolated at the beginning of the regular data file, creating a corrupted
     report. Now the step list option is visible whenever it can be applied to a test, so the user should see
     whether it is selected or not. Also added a check at the end of the test selection form to turn off the
     step list option if it cannot be used with the test type chosen.
     Also re-enabled the "show test results in capwin" option in the Preferences window -- and disabled the
     temporary hack that always turned it on.

6.71.73) 5-12-05 rvw
  1) Some key values are now required to be above 0.  If you enter a 0 or negative value, the old
     value will remain.  If the old value is <=0, it will be reset to the default value.  These
     parameters are surface tension, diameter, thickness, density, and mass.  Cyl_len is allowed to
     be 0, as this is normal for flat sheets.  SCDiam is allowed to have any value because if it is
     less than the normal diameter it is ignored.
  2) Fixed problem in lohm calibration that would sometimes cause it to stop before it even started.

6.71.72) 4-25-05 rvw
  1) Fixed elevated pressure test with one single very high pressure - if you got too close to the
     maximum pressure it could try to set the gauge index to -1, which is not valid.

6.71.71) 4-21-05 rvw
  1) Fixed curve fit so it now works with permeability files (this was broken in 6.71.70 when
     support was added for temperature data files).

6.71.70) 4-18-05 rvw
  1) Rewrote curve fit to use standard data file i/o routines.  This allows temperature data to
     be used in the curve fit routine.

6.71.69) 4-12-05 rvw
  1) (rvw) Fixed increment of I/P regulator during integrity test.  It would increment too much if you
     tried to use a pressure regulator increment less than 1.

6.71.68) 3-16-05 rvw, MJLC final on 4-7-05
  1) If you try to take more than 32000 data points, the test will automatically turn or abort.  This
     stops an overflow that would happen at 32767 data points due to integer indexing of arrays.
  2) If the open limit from valve 2 reads more than 65000 counts, it will give an error message.  This
     has happened once when a valve pot board was shorted out.
  3) Fixed some temperature reading problems with new temperature system and recirculation and liquid
     permeability, and some door switch issues where old Ballard door switch code would interfere with newer
     Rabbit door switch method (where it didn't interfere with older George door switch method).
  4) Fixed some piston actuation problems in two-pass tests on recirculation machines
  5) Fixed temperature sensor readings in porometry data file.
  6) (MJLC) Fixed problem in display of pressure step list checkbox in test selection form. Was not being
     displayed properly because a check of the liquid perm state was being called during the form load method,
     and the default liquid perm state turned off the pressure step list option.
  7) (rvw) Added button to data editor to strip temperature data from a file.
  8) (rvw) Fixed invalid parameter error when loading auto parm form - caused by slider initialization and
     bubble flow value > 30.
  9) (MJLC) Added running statistics (avg and stdev) to data reported in log file for a porometry or BP test.
  10) (MJLC) Fixed(?) a bug where the "dry parameter" label in test setup was indented relative to the others.
  11) (MJLC) Added regulator switching to the pressure step list routine.
  12) (rvw)  Added check for pressure and flow stagnation when using first of two regulators.  This allows
     switching to the second regulator even before the first regulator reaches 100% if the flow rate is
     so high that the first regulator can't increase the pressure or flow any more.  This is only working
     for the lohm calibration for now, and could use some improvement.

6.71.67) 2-17-05 rvw
  1) Added support for bubbler attachment.  This is turned on by "bubbler_enable=Y" in capwin.ini file.
    Moves valve 3 to inside of valve 4, valve 4 leads to the bubbler, a second valve 3 is on the other
    side of the bubbler.  Valve 4 stays closed except when actually running a test (to avoid back flow
    of water from bubbler).  Valve 4 is still operated in reverse (close commands causes it to open) due
    to historic nature of valve having been 3-way valve in earlier machines.  Valve 4 is now closed
    at end of test when there is still pressure on the system.  After 3 seconds (to allow valve to actually
    close) the pressure is then relieved and both valves 3 open to vent the system.  It stays in this
    configuration until the next test is started.
  2) Changed the way temperature probes are allocated.  Previously, the "Temperature" configuration
    value was set to "N" for no temperature probes, "Y" for 1 temperature probe, or "2" for two temperature
    probes.  The allocation of these probes depended on if the system had liquid permeability or not.
    There was no support for the new Rabbit pass-through serial ports to talk to a Watlow.  Now, there are
    three new configuration variables that replace the "Temperature" and "external_watlow_com_number"
    configuration values.  "DryChamberTemperature", "WetChamberTemperature", and "ReservoirTemperature".
    These default at "0", to mean that there is no probe in this section.  When set to "G1" or "G2", this
    means the probe uses the old V6 and V7 aux port 1 or 2 (channels 27 or 30).  When set to "C1A", this
    means that the probe is on channel A of a Watlow connected to the computer's COMM port 1.  When set to
    "R1A", this means that the probe is on channel A of a Watlow connected to the Rabbit V8 board
    pass-through COMM port 1.  If none of these are set in the configuration file, the old "Temperature"
    and "external_watlow_com_number" values are read in and used to set an initial condition of these new
    variables.  If these is a conflict when trying to set these values, a warning message will be shown
    (such as when "Temperature" says there are two probes but the system doesn't have a liquid chamber).
  3) New configuration variable "valve_limit_offset", which defaults to 0.  Set this higher if you are
    having problems where valve 2 is not able to reach the close limit but always stays slightly above it.

6.71.66) 2-1-05 to 2-7-05, MJLC, RVW
  1) Made the pressure increment for the initial increase in the microflow test a variable (xregstep in
    capwin.ini). Previously hard-coded to be 10. This could probably be added to the Preferences form, but
    hasn't been yet.        -- MJLC
  2) Fixed multi-chamber select form - due to a bug in the way the language file was read in, all the
    chamber checkboxes would be called "chamber 1".
  3) Fixed multi-chamber support for version 8 machines.  In version 8, chamber select valves 1 through 5
    use the same solenoid valve circuits as valves 4, 20, 19, 21, and 22.  These numbered valves are not
    present in a multi-chamber system, but the valve commands can incorrectly move the chamber select
    valves.  This is now blocked in the Move_Valve routine.
  4) Added support for 2 chamber multi-chamber system.  Previously, chambers=2 signified that there was
    a liquid chamber and an air chamber, and chambers>=3 signified a true multi-chamber system.  Now,
    if chambers=2 and the machine does not do liquid permeability (or only does liquid permeability
    and does not do gas permeability) then it will be considered a multi chamber system.  Not all
    combinations of this have been tested.

6.71.65) 1-31-05 MJLC
  1) Bug fixes for the free-pressure test (Saint Gobain's thing).

6.71.64) 1-21-05 MJLC
  1) Added support for a new type of test: a multi-test averaging gas perm routine. Preferences are set
   in the Gas Perm tab of the settings pane. The methodology is similar to the loopingDemo functionality
   that exists. User enters the number of tests he wants to run. The software automatically loops through
   Run_C_Pass and RunTest without pausing between tests; each data file has a number appended to its name
   and is saved as normal. A summary file with the extension "_summary.cft" uses CalcGP to figure out the
   average darcy value for each result and print it to the file. At the end of the last test, the average of
   the averages is calculated and written to the summary file.
  2) Modified calcGP. This calculated an average darcy number as a weighted average with respect to flow. Caprep,
   however, does it with respect to pressure. Dr. Jena and Dr. Gupta agreed that it would be better to standardize
   around pressure. (Now we can start reporting the result at the end of the test again!)

6.71.63) 1-19-05 MJLC
  1) Bug fix in pressure step routine: when the interpolated data file was created, the wet and dry
   curves were saved with the same number of points as in the original file. If there were more points
   in the pressure list than in the data file, the last interpolated values would not be saved.

6.71.62) 1-12-05
  1) Automatic curve fit won't work on bubble point tests.  -- MJLC
  2) Fixes made to pore diameter option (pressure conversion removed, trap for 0 diameter) by Ron.
  3) Bug fix in pressure hold routine: crashed if more than 100 data points were recorded.
  4) Statistics.bas (in common library) was updated to use long values instead of integer (again for
   pressure hold test).

6.71.61) 12-14-04 MJLC
  1) Added a wait time to the piston/compression close routine. This is meant to give the piston
   time to fully close in systems where it may take a while. Set as piston_delay_time in capwin.ini;
   variable is pistonDelayTime.
  2) Fixed a bug in the pressure step list editor where lists with 10 or more points were not loaded correctly.
  3) Wait for flow meter stability is now bypassed for liquid perm tests as well as pressure hold.
  4) Added support for use of a pressure step list in elevated liquid perm tests.
  5) Expanded the step list interpolation done at the end of a test for gas perm to include liquid perm and
   cfp tests as well.
  6) Tortuosity factor not printed in data file for permeability or pressure hold tests.

6.71.60) 12-10-04 MJLC
  1) Changed the "test by pore diameter" option so that min and max values are displayed
   correctly in the setup form when flipping back and forth between the two options.
  2) Test setup form is now "dirty" if min or max pressure/diameter is changed.
  3) Added an "experimental" label to the main form that becomes visible if "x" is appended
   to the global version number (S_Version$). This should prevent accidental release of
   untested code.
  4) Added a new prefs tab, "Special Options". First special option is zeroTempAtEndOfTest,
   which determines whether or not the temperature should be zeroed at the end of run_c_pass.

6.71.59) 12-10-04 MJLC
  1) Bug fix in the Saint Gobain routine (x5-->x4)

6.71.58) 12-6-04 rvw
  1) Added support for looping demo when running dry up/wet up test.  First loop will run
   normally, but subsequent loops will re-run the dry up part of the test and then use
   the data from the wet up part of the first loop.

6.71.57) 12-1-04 MJLC
  1) Log file option preference was not being saved properly. Fixed.
  2) Modified testscrn form_load method by setting dirty=false. This will prevent program
   from asking user if he wants to save changes if all he's done is opened the form and closed
   it again without touching any of the controls.
  3) Disabled the pressure unit check at the beginning of save_user_global_stuff. The called routine
   was moved to the preferences form some time ago, meaning that every time the save routine was
   called it was reloading the preferences form in the background just to run the pressure check.
   The check isn't needed here anyway since the units can only be changed now in prefs form.
  4) During main flow test (either wet or dry), stop endless retrying to increase pressure if we are
   already at 4000 counts on an i/p regulator.  This will stop tests when they can't go on any
   further, and allow dual regulator systems a chance to switch to the higher regulator where they
   would otherwise hang. (12-2-04 rvw)
  5) Multiplier for pressure regulator increment is normally 50 (to compensate for differences between
   version 6 and 7 machines).  This is now lowered to 7 for second regulator in dual regulator
   machines to compensate for the second regulator being 7 times the maximum pressure.  Also added
   delay during the change in regulators to let it settle better.  This may help stop a large
   jump in the data when we switch regulators.

6.71.56) 11-30-04 MJLC
  1) Disabled part of the new liquid balance routines because they were causing an overflow error
   during a regular elevated liquid perm test.
  2) Moved the ambient liquid perm test routine out of run_c_pass into its own routine (Run_Ambient_LqPerm)
   in an effort to simplify and modularize run_c_pass.
  3) Made some modifications for the special Saint Gobain test again.

6.71.55) 9-16-04 MJLC
  1) More changes to the Saint Gobain test: 5 second delay after acquiring a point, changes to
   the formatting of the excel spreadsheet.

6.71.54) 9-7-04 to 9-16-04 Ron
  1) Fixed some things in elevated pressure liquid permeability that were messed up when the
   new optional balance code was inserted for microflow liquid permeability.

6.71.53) 9-3-04  MJLC
  1) Modified Run_C_Pass and UpdateLine25 so that pore diameter is only displayed if the test type
   is porometry or bubble point.
  2) Modified the special Saint Gobain "free pressure test" -- now includes more test parameters,
   Excel file output, two methods of triggering a read, and permeability calculation. Test is still
   only accessible by enabling the "Saint Gobain" button in Testscrn at compile time.

6.71.52) 8-30-04 MJLC
  Fixed display problems in the single-point gas perm test, updated language files for same, and
   made the "setup" button for it in the "select test" form functional.

6.71.51) 8-30-04 Ron
 Leak test now sets the proper regulator on a dual regulator machine
  It does this based on the maximum pressure for the leak test, at the
  beginning of the leak test.  It does not try to switch regulators in
  the middle of the leak test.

6.71.50) 8/26/05 TAR---Test_Done() open the drain code moved for liq perm

6.71.49) 8-25-04 Ron
 Fixed problem added in 6.71.47-8 when running dry curve first could cause overflow on some
  machines due to no bubble point being defined at the beginning of the dry curve.

6.71.48) 8-24-04 Ron
  Fixed problem where bottom-up liquid permeametry with very low flow sample and compression
  could cause pressure buildup during initial attempt at moving the penetrometer magnet into
  range so that the compression piston would be lifted up by the pressure on the sample.

6.71.47) 8-19-04 Ron
 1) Fix bug in update_units_check.  If they had previously selected a non-standard unit for
  pressure and that unit is not defined any more (maybe they changed the capwin.ini file
  because they switched machines) they would get an error when they tried to load the
  preferences form because it couldn't find the unit it thought they wanted.  Now it just
  defaults back to PSIA if it can't find the unit they wanted.
 2) Added language support to the two new items added in 46
 3) Added support for compression piston in leak test, lohm calibration, regulator calibration,
  and chamber volume calibration (piston was already supported in microflow volume calibration
  so chamber volume calibration is now using the same routine as the microflow volume calibration
  except it exits after the first pass).
 4) Fixed problem seen in Brazil where conversion of tortuosity factor of .715 was causing
  a "type mismatch" error.  All reading in of configuration settings that should be numbers
  is now put through the "val" function to convert to a number using US standard.  (All
  configuration settings are stored as US standard so configuration files can be moved
  anywhere in the world.  Numbers are displayed and entered from the user using whatever
  the local standard actually is.)
 5) Fixed some places on the preferences form where str$ was used and it should have been
  format$ to allow local decimal points.  Also, when these text values are read back in
  they have to use myVal instead of Val so it will properly convert.
 6) Fixed other areas on older forms where they used str$ instead of format$.
 7) Fixed keypress restrictions on data editor to allow local decimal character
 8) Fixed pressure regulator setting after bubble point that may have been setting the pressure
  regulator too high for the first part of the wet curve

6.71.46) 8-18-04 Ron
 1) New variable "min_flow_in_dry", defaults to 0.  If set non-zero, then dry curve going up
  will skip data points in same way as "use_min_pressure_in_dry"
  Also has "use_min_flow_in_dry" to turn it on
 2) Also fixed bug introduced somewhere between 35 and 38 where liquid permeability would mess
  up calibration values for low pressure gauge, thus messing up dry curves.

6.71.45) 8-12-04 MJLC
 1) Added a new "single point gas perm test" for Sam Bo. There is an option for it in the
  test selection window, as well as a Gas Perm preference pane in the preferences window.
  The test uses the pressure step list pressurization routine to reach a target pressure
  point, then holds that point for an assigned period of time, taking data points at specified
  intervals. Currently it creates a test data file along with the normal file. **** THIS HAS NOT
  BEEN COMPLETELY TESTED YET ****

6.71.44) 8/9/04 TAR---g_bBalanceNotPenet_zeroPoint added

6.71.43) 8/6/04 TAR---Added key-cancel to drain feature, moved drain feature in CAPFLOW.BAS.
  Fixed Settling feature so that it doesn't eat into the sampling time.

6.71.42) 8/4/04 TAR---Added settling time for each press target, plus indicators "Waiting" and
  "Settling". Now a new dialog parameter box comes up prior to Autotest for the settling time.
  Added drain at the end of autotest. Fixed targeting at 0 PSI. Localized 10mL max for Mettler.
  Debugging file output during Run_Elev_LqPerm. TAR_Util.BAS for Progress_Output line items. ptarg
  double-checks. All sorts of good stuff.

6.71.41) 7-26-04 MJLC
 1) Fixed bug introduced in previous version merge where hydrohead test option was never visible.

6.71.40) 7-23-04 MJLC
 1) Updated language files for Mr. Yaza.

6.71.39)EdC 7-22-04 The slider(1) of the autoparm form was altered to effect only the
  Bubblepoint aspect of the test.
  Language files updated for new sliders and v.38x (MJLC)

6.71.38x) 7-22-04 Ron
 1) Added support for exclusive hydrohead tester (setup for bubble point tester
  and then set "hydrohead=E" in capwin.ini file).

6.71.38) 7-21-04 MJLC
 1) Added an option to automatically curve-fit the data file at the end of a test. Done by
  calling the curve fitting routine in Curve from do_final_copy. Preference added to the
  "tests" tab of the preferences form. Also added a "curve fit" tab to preferences with
  the appropriate parameters.

6.71.37  Optimized code for fast target pressure acquisition for Becton-Dickinson. TAR040622

6.71.36) 04 06 06 Tim - Added Mettler Balance in place of penetrometer for
  Becton-Dickinson

6.71.35) 5-24-04 MJLC
 1) Updated language files in "About", main form, manual control, pressure step list, and
  autocal.

6.71.34) 5-19-94 MJLC
 1) Localized a label in calib_reg that I'd overlooked.

6.71.33) 5-14-03 Ron
 1) All pleasewait.hide changed to unload pleasewait.  If you were running qc mode and
  ran a test it would leave the pleasewait form loaded but hidden and quiting the
  program from the qc main form did not unload it so the program stayed on but hidden.
  Also changed lv_man_ctrl from hide to unload and then commented it out because
  by that point in the program the form had already been unloaded.
 2) Leave venting valve open at the end of the pressure hold test.  On some systems
  the vent wouldn't have been left open long enough to properly vent the entire
  system, so leaving the venting valve open until they try to run something else
  should be better.
 3) Modified bubble point routine so it won't trigger the bubble point if the pressure
  drop was caused by a change in the range of the pressure gauge.

6.71.32) 04 05 14 Search for Tim Richards - This code is for the LEP.
  added global boolean g_bBalanceNotPenet and the subroutine ReadBalanceNotPenet.
  This subroutine is called by ReadXReturnX4 after which ReadXReturnX4 immediately quits and
  passes back the value. The global is set by reading the H2OPerm ini switch, set to B,
  along with feature 16 set (meaning liquid permeametry).

6.71.31) 5-11-04 Ron
 Fixed timer so that it won't lock up on requested delay of 0 seconds.  This showed up when you
  tried to run a leak test with the read delay parameter set to 0.

6.71.30) 5-11-04 MJLC
 1) Further updated the language files at the request of Mr. Yaza.

6.71.29) 04 05 10 Tim
    line 15114 modifying the report writing code initially to work with Heidi's ambient/elevated
    liquid perm data files. Procedure RunTest(). Series of Select/Case. This code is written
    line-wise, not report-wise, which makes it difficult to add a line into a single report -
    difficult to parse.

6.71.28) 4-29-04 Ron
 1) Added support for digital door switch in compression systems.  Autopiston systems always had the
   door switch of this type.  Recirculation systems alway have a door switch of a different type.
   Both autopiston and compression can have the safety keypress system.
   Now, setting safetyup or safetydown to "A" (it used to be "Y" or "N") means that instead of a
   key press it now requires the door switch.  The safety keypress module now can release on the door
   switch or the key press depending on the "Y" or "A".
 2) Changed low flow calibration routine so it applies temporary higher flow target at beginning if the
   low flow controller is not responding.  This should make it work with newer flow controllers that
   are slow to respond at the very beginning.

6.71.27) 4-27-04 Ron
 Added support for microflow gas permeability, just like microflow porometry

6.71.26) 4-27-04 MJLC
 1) Updated strings in language file to incorporate recent program additions.

6.71.25) 4-26-04 Ron
 Changed waiting and rs232 communication so that it releases time to the cpu whenever it is waiting.
 Many time delays changed to calls to existing waitseconds routine.
 waitseconds changed to use new waitms routine (in wait.bas module)
 waitms2 routine added to wait.bas module to handle second comm port (for watlow)

6.71.24) 4-23-04 Ron
 Added in features from branched version 6.71.22a and 6.71.22b
 1) (from 22b) Tuned up pressure regulator switchin in the middle of bubble point to make it work better
 2) (from 22a) if Compression_Increase_Factor is negative, limit the maximum pressure for
 the test to the compression pressure divided by the absolute value of the Compression_Increase_Factor.
 (If the Compression_Increase_Factor is positive, the compression pressure is increased as the testing
 pressure goes up.  If it is zero, the compression pressure remains a constant and there is no limit
 to the maximum pressure of the test.)

6.71.23b) 4-15-04 MJLC
 1) Automatic calibration of pressure gauges, too!

6.71.23a) 4-9-04 MJLC
 1) Changed the "Autocal" form so that calibration of flow meters is, indeed, automatic.

6.71.23) 3-29-04 MJLC
 1) Rearranged items in TitleScrn.Load() so that the "languages" folder isn't created in
  a code directory. (If by chance capwin.ini isn't found, the error message will come up in
  English, not the user's preferred language.)

6.71.22) 3-25-04 Ron - added in more pressure regulator switching

6.71.21) MJLC 3-24-04  No new changes -- this is a version of the code integrating Ron's v6.71.20 with Matt's
 v. 6.71.19a-d.

6.71.20) 3-5-04 Ron
 1) Added support for switching high flow meters without moving valve 10.  This happens when
  the variable "suspend_v10" is true.  New variable switch_high_flow_enabled must be true.
 2) Added capwin parameter second_regulator_starting_point, which is the number of counts of
  the second regulator that equals the 4000 count point of the first regulator.  This defaults
  to 0, which suspends its usage
 3) The learning routine for deltap=0 liquid perm tests is now disabled for pressures less than
  25 PSI.  It wasn't working for really low pressures, and the customer who wants this is only
  using pressures of about 70 PSI.  If there is customer demand, maybe this will be made to work
  on low pressure tests as well.
 4) Added trap for bad value for penetrometer_start_test_point - if it is lower than 50% of the
  average of pen500 and pen20500, it will be reset to pen500.

6.71.19d) 3-22-04 MJLC
 1) Added a custom test type for Saint-Gobain. It allows them to set the regulator and v2,
   clamp a test fixture down onto a sample, wait a few seconds, and take a reading. For now,
   since this is in the developmental stages, this is activated by a button in Autotest marked
   "Saint Gobain". This button is hidden unless sending a new executable to SG.
    More modifications to CVCalc to get all the checks working with the new calculation.

6.71.19c) 3-18-04 MJLC
 1) Modified lohm back-correction to use the new formula Ron calculated.

6.71.19b) 3-17-04 MJLC
 1) Modified openv2completely to trap possible error reading open limit in Sam Bo/SK machine.

6.71.19a) 3-16-04 MJLC
 1) Fine-tuned pressure step list routine to work better in bar for Sam Bo

6.71.19) 2-24-04 MJLC
 1) Fixed a bug in the pressure step list interface; list is now sorted properly as values are
  entered.
 2) Moved the "Change Supervisor Password" menu item to the Mode menu (under Group).
 3) Added a Debug menu to TitleScrn. This is intended to give easy access to the various debugging
  variables without having to change the ini file. The menu is hidden to the user unless
  debugMenuVisible=Y. Initial values are taken from the ini file. For now, checking or unchecking
  an item will make it valid while capwin is open, but changes are not saved. The "stability debug"
  option is a little different: toggling it does not turn on stability_debug, but makes the original
  menu item in the Progress screen visible.

6.71.18) 2-14-04 Ron
 1) Added interpolation of the data file at the end of the gas permeability test if you are
  using the pressure step routine.  The original raw data is stored to lastdata.cft.  The
  interpolated data is stored to lastdata2.cft and then copied to where they wanted it.

6.71.17)  1-23-04 Ron
 1) Added support for external Watlow connected to second serial port of computer.  You have
   to edit the capwin.ini file to set this up and enable it.
 2) If the external Watlow is enabled and working, collect temperature data from it during the
   gas permeability test, and use the "TEMPERATURESENSOR" header on the data file to signify
   that there is one set of temperature data present.  Note that we haven't used this header
   in such a long time that the current report program does not support it.  (It supports the
   "TEMPERATURESENSOR2" header that signifies two temperature sensors for liquid permeability
   tests.
 3) Added support for "TEMPERATURESENSOR" header in common routines for loading and saving of
   data files.
 4) Added support for new valve 23, for liquid sample chamber drain.  Currently it is only
   supported for recirculation systems, and it is closed before recirc1 is entered and only
   opened manually when you are able to open the sample chamber.  You open it first, to drain
   out the excess liquid before you open the sample chamber.

6.71.16)  1-12-04 Ron
 1) Removed unload of piston in load sample routine if you just did a vacuum purge or if
   you have the load prompts turned off.  This caused a problem for GE where the piston
   would unload and then load again and this could cause the piston to pop up and then back
   down before their test started.

6.71.15)  1-9-04 Ron
 1) Added "learning" of pressure overshoot during single pressure elevated pressure liquid
   permeability (deltap=0).  It remembers the overshoot from the pressure target (if any) and
   applies this to the next deltap=0 test as long as the target pressure remains the same as
   the last test.
 2) Also fixed problem where if you only have one defined group (apart from the default group)
   and you are currently in that defined group and tell the program to delete groups it would
   crash.  (This is because you can't delete the default group or the current group, so the
   list of possible groups you can delete was empty and it didn't like this.)  Now, in this
   situation, it will put up the empty box saying there are no groups you can delete, just as
   if there was only the default group.

6.71.14)  1-2-04   MJLC
 1) Made pressure step list follow user's choice of pressure units -- previously was assuming
   PSI only.

6.71.13)  12-18-03 MJLC
 1) Found that the code initializing the pressure step list was missing in the latest version,
   causing an error. Added it back in.

6.71.12)  12-9-03 Ron
 1) Added "pause" button to lohm calibration status form.  This allows the operator to pause
   the lohm calibration to let the compressor catch up with the pressure.

6.71.11)  11-26-03 MJLC
 1) Modified "pass/fail" option in select_test so that it's only shown when valid (i.e. for
   capflow and BP.
 2) Fixed a bug in the changing of length units in preferences.
 3) Added support for setting a pressure list for a capflow or gasperm test. Use PS_usingList to
   determine if the option is being used. Lists are created from the "pressure list" menu option
   under "Modify" and specified for a test in the select_Test window. Control code is in run_c_pass
   starting in section 3251 and 3300.

6.71.10a) 11-17-03
 1a) Changed default minimum_liquid_test_stop_point to the top of the penetrometer.
   It had been 50% on the penetrometer and if you are running a non-porous sample
   you will never get this low and the test will never end.
 2b) Added "charset" setting in set_fontname (it was already in set_fontstuff) so the
   "pleasewait" form shows properly in Japanese.
 3c) Fixed problem where if you have a valid SCDiam (from a previous ESA test), it would
   be stored in subsequent gas or liquid permeability test files, which the report program
   can't handle.
 4c) In liquid permeability, if the starting pressure is 0 and the penetrometer is above the
   the penetrometer_start_test_point, the regulator will be increased slowly, up to a maximum
   of 2 PSI above atmospheric pressure, until the penetrometer gets in range, and then the
   regulator will be zeroed and the penetrometer vented before the test is actually started.
 5d) Made some more variables double (for pressure storage) so they appear correct when shown
   back to the user.
 6d) Added capwin parameter of Compression_Increase_Factor, which defaults to 0 to disable the
   new effect.  If you are running with a positive compression pressure, the compression pressure
   will be increased as you run the test so that the actual compression pressure is always at
   least the compression pressure you asked for plus the Compression_Increase_Factor multiplied
   by the current testing pressure.  A good Compression_Increase_Factor for normal pistons is 2.
   This was discovered experimentally.  This will stop the sample chamber from opening up when the
   force trying to open the sample chamber due to the testing pressure exceeds the compression force
   trying to keep it closed.
 7e) Use Compression_Increase_Factor in the elevated pressure liquid permeability test as well.
 8e) Changed regulator calibration so it takes more points at the beginning of the curve.

6.71.09) 11-13-03
 1) Added units to some of the extended information added to the data file

6.71.08) 10-27-03
 1) Fixed problem introduced in version 6.71.06 when writing microflow settling
   parameters, this would cause liquid permeability tests with temperature information
   to get messed up during the final file copy.

6.71.07) 10-17-03
 1) Changed name of "recirculation 1" and "recirculation 2" to "Partial Recirculation"
   and "Full Recirculation" at the request of Ballard.
 2) New parameter in the capwin.ini file: minimum_liquid_test_stop_point
   This defaults to the 50% point of the penetrometer.  At the end of the liquid
   test, if you run out of data points or maximum pressure, the test will continue
   until the penetrometer reaches this point or below before terminating.  This is
   so that the penetrometer is low enough so that when you open the sample chamber
   there will be room for the liquid in the chamber to go back into the penetrometer
   and you don't build up too much liquid so it overflows when you open the chamber.

6.71.06) 10-3-03
 1) Vacuum Purge is now available for those systems with "vacuum_purge_enable"
 2) Microflow Settling parameters are stored to the data file, along with the final
   settling time.  This requires that the data file be read in and re-written after
   the test is over because the total settling time is stored in the header of the
   file, and this is written before the test is started and the total settling time
   is not determined until the test starts.  If there is anything else about the data
   that needs to be changed after the test, this will be a good place to put it.
 3) Changed the NOWHERE counter so it lets the test go longer with no data in attempt
   to stop special regulator-only tests from timing out before any real data is
   collected when the regulator has a large zero offset.
 4) Moved compression pressure storage to user ini file so each user could have his
   own compression pressure.  Piston area is still a system-wide variable since no
   matter how many users, they will all still use the same piston.
 5) Test changes for Seika Toyota - valve setup sequence for air-bottom hydrohead
   with lower penetrometer
 6) Changed elevated liquid perm so first part doesn't wait for pressure increase
   if you are running deltap=0 (for ballard)

6.71.05) 9-30-03
 1) Fixed problem where recirculation systems, when running tests other than liquid
   permeability, can get a "subscript" error at then end of the test.  This is due
   to the temperature array being read when it had not been filled.

6.71.04) 9-29-03
 1) Fixed problem introduced on around 9/8/03.  On systems without microflow, if you
   enter the test type selection form it will improperly enable the microflow test
   type.  If you then run any type of test and enter manual control from within the
   test, it will get an overflow error when it tries to read the microflow pressure
   gauge.

6.71.03) 9-22-03
 1) Cleared out some counters when you exit from hold during the bubble point routine
   to try to fix problem with overflow reported by Seika in Japan.
 2) Fixed test setup so if you change the preferences for seal length while you
   are in the setup screen it will correctly show the microflow test parameters.
 3) Split variables for hold time and pressure for pressure hold test and microflow
   They used to interfere with one another if you switched between the two types of
   tests.  Also, the preferences window allows setting of the hold time for the
   pressure hold test, and this could mess up the microflow test.

6.71.02) 9-16-03
 1) For recirculation systems, added pulse of fill valve open and close at end of test
   to relieve any built-up pressure back into the fill tank before opening the sample
   chamber.  Seika reported that with some samples they would have a blast of liquid
   when opening the sample chamber at the end of the test.
 2) Added temporary output file during recirculation liquid permeability.  This will
   eventually be added to standard data file.
 3) In elevated pressure liquid permeability, if the penetrometer is still above the
   penetrometer_start_test_point, the main routine will not take any data until the
   penetrometer has dropped down enough.
 4) Program no longer crashes if you try to delete users when there are no users
   other than the default user (which you can't delete).  This problem showed up
   when the user list became sorted.
 5) On systems with the new door lock, it now prompts them to open the door in the
   middle of two-pass tests (because they need to be able to open the sample chamber
   to wet the sample and reinstall it or put in a dry sample.

6.71.01) MJLC 9-15-03
 1) Added a shortcut to the preferences window from the test setup screen.
 2) Added a checkbox for the "linear seal" microflow option on the test selection screen.
 3) Modified the linear seal functionality: added an indicator variable (seal_state) to
   differentiate between a simple entered seal diameter and the case where cyl_len > 0,
   where we need to enter both an inner and outer diameter. Set up do_final_copy to print
   inner and outer diameter if they are non-zero; calculations for effective diameter
   will be done in caprep.
 4) Added support for recording temperature directly into a microflow file. This is
   indicated by the special filetype "DIFFPERM+t" and flagged in the software by MF_recordTemperature.

6.71) Released 8-29-03

6.70.61)
 1) End of high pressure liquid permeability test changed for airtop machines to minimize
   getting fluid back into the pressure manifold.
 2) Added support for auxin bit in version 7 feature number (=1024)
   Manual control screen can now handle both compression pressure and temperature readings
   Whichever was the last one you clicked on will be the one displayed (since they both use
   the same line on the display)
 3) Prompt for step pressure moved to before prompt for maximum pressure in elevated liquid
   perm test, so if step pressure is 0 it won't bother to prompt for the maximum pressure.
   If the step pressure is 0, the test will automatically run to the end of the penetrometer
   or to the maximum number of data points (whichever hits first) and then stop.  The maximum
   pressure will be ignored.
 4) Door switch added for recirculation test.  If door is opened, the test will abort.  Also
   you can't go into recirc2 with the door open, and if you are in recirc2 and open the door it
   will go back into recirc1.
 5) Added optional delay to wait for stable pressure before microflow pressure test.
 6) Changed order of valves for liquid perm test to help avoid getting liquid in the pressure
   side.
 7) Added support for "doorlock" boolean - if you have a door lock and need to use a special
   command to open it back up.
 8) Moved compression pressure entry to beginning of test setup so it will be done before the
   header is written to the data file so we can write the compression information to the data
   file.
 9) If you have temperature reading, the main testing routine will log temperature and pressure
   and flow to a "tempdata1.txt" or "tempdata2.txt" file in the main directory.  Wet curve will
   be in "tempdata1.txt", and dry curve will be in "tempdata2.txt".  Microflow data is still in
   "tempdata.txt".  This will be overwritten by the next test.  If you have two temperature
   probes, the second one will be used for the tempdata file (as the first one is assumed to be
   for the liquid permeability chamber).  Also, recirculation systems do not zero the liquid
   temperature at the beginning and end of the test, but leave it at whatever you had it set to.

6.70.60)
 1) Added support for "recirculation=Y" - recirculation pump and two more valves for liquid perm
   as used on the Ballard machine.
 2) Now zeroes compression regulator (electronics version) before setting the compression
   pressure.  It had left the pressure alone, which could result in too high a compression
   pressure.  This was discovered on the GE machine.  This doesn't affect motorized compression
   regulators like on Ballard.
 3) Doesn't ask for seal diameter if you don't have the microflow seal length option turned on.
   and doesn't save the seal length to the data file unless the option is turned on and the
   diameter is greater than 0.

6.70.59)
 1) Added a new function, File_Exists, and used it to check for the presence of the lohm
    file specified in user preferences when the software is loading. (load_user_global_stuff)

6.70.58) -- MJLC 7/30/03
 1) Moved the "microflow porometry" option in select_test because it was covering up "square root" calc dry. (select_test)
 2) Fixed a bug where "use min pressure in dry curve" pref. wasn't being saved properly. (prefs form)
 3) Changed Load_Sample so that we don't have to wait for flow meter stability when
    doing a pressure hold test.
 4) Enabled launching caprep at end of test for BP, LV perm, and press. hold tests. (start_caprep variable)
 5) Changed pressure hold test so that graph does not scale out automatically if not checking dp/dt.
 6) Updated language file. (loadtextstrings in each form and ts variable definitions at top)
 7) Fixed a bug in the pressure hold test where pressure drop was not calculated correctly
   for tests measuring PSI/min.  (in pressure_hold)
 8) Added P to the bubble point log. (BPdebuglog.txt)

6.70.57)
 1) Improved the autocal interface: "stop" button works, user can set maximum pressure/flow,
   final report shows correct percentages, better regulation.           -- MJLC 7/3/03

6.70.56)
 1) New autocal routine for calibration of pressure gauges and flow meters. Accessible via manual control.
   Still pretty buggy.                                                  -- MJLC 6/20/03

6.70.55)
 1) Partial update to language files.                                   -- MJLC 6/17/03
 2) Fixed a bug in the looping GP and BP tests, although there may still be a problem running
   a looping BP test when "auto increment filenames" is checked.        -- MJLC 6/17/03

6.70.54)
 1) Added an option to input a "seal length" for microflow tests so that flow can be calculated
   as passing through a linear length instead of a cross-sectional area.        -- MJLC 6/16/03

6.70.53)
 1) ADC calibration form now correctly resizes for version 6 machines.  It had resized to
   hide those parts that are only used by version 7, but then the form was expanded
   and it then resized too much and the exit button was partially hidden.
 2) Now allows use of motorized compression regulator on version 7 porometers by setting
   motorized_compression_regulator=Y.
 3) two-stage filling now works for any bottom-up autofill liquid permeability
   test, not just for liquid perm only machines.
 4) New variable max_fill_point, which defaults to the pen500 value.  This is where the
   autofill valve will close during filling for liquid permeability.
 5) New option under preferences for liquid permeability for compression and autopiston
   machines - you can select to delay the compression until after the initial fill or
   do the compression before the initial fill.
 6) New variable piston_area gives the compression piston cross sectional area.  This
   defaults to 1 square inch.  This, coupled with the user's entry of the sample cross
   sectional area, is used to modify the compression pressure value that is entered
   into a value for compressive force on the sample.

6.70.52)
 1) Microflow volume calibration now uses a lower pressure for the flow controller
   because some flow controllers would leak at high pressure.  It now uses the the
   max_bp_pres_dif plus 14.7 for the initial pressure so it guarantees that it can
   keep flowing all the way up to 14.7 above atmospheric pressure.

6.70.51)
 1) After the penetrometer reaches the penetrometer_start_test_point, the air pressure
   that was used to move it to this point is released so we start at as low a pressure
   as possible.
 2) Target pressure for elevates pressure liquid permeability now takes into account
   the liquid level height.  This mainly affects low pressure testing.
 3) min and max pressure boxes only appear if you are doing a test that uses these
   values.  (liquid perm, pressure hold, microflow so not use these)
 4) tortuosity factor box only appears if you are doing a test that uses this.
 5) Improved selection of dual regulator for liquid perm, pressure hold, and microflow
   so selection is based on maximum pressure for these tests, which are entered
   differently, not the maximum pressure from the parameter file or test setup
   screen (since this is now hidden for these types of tests).

6.70.50)
 1) Initial autofill of penetrometer for bottom-up machines has been improved.
   New variable bottom_fill_point.  The isolation valve (valve 20) will be closed
   when this point is reached during fill, and then the penetrometer will be
   filled up to the top and then valve 20 will be opened.  This should fill the
   sample better and top off any space above the sample when using adapter plates.
   New variable sample_zero_point gives the height on the penetrometer where
   the sample is actually at zero.
   When the penetrometer is refilled, it will also use this dual-stage filling method.
   A new button in manual control will allow you to set the sample_zero_point and
   the bottom_fill_point.  These may be removed at some later time when an automated
   method for determining these is developped.
   A new preference for liquid perm is added - norefill.  If true, the elevated pressure
   test will not attempt to refill the penetrometer - the test will end if a single
   pass of the penetrometer is not enough to get all the data points we asked for.
 2) After initial fill, the regulator is increased slowly to make the penetrometer go down
   until it reaches the penetrometer_start_test_point (in cm).

6.70.49)
 1) Initial pressure regulator increase is removed if you have a solenoid valve 2.
   This stops the first data point from being too high.

6.70.48)
 1) Moved diffpg reading in capstuff reading to above liqpermonly initialization.
   if you have a diffpg and no high flow meter, you are now a microflow porometer
   and liqpermonly is not turned on.
 2) OpenV2Pos now opens solenoid valve if there is one
 3) Changes to diffperm test at end when lowering pressure slowly
 4) Changes to find_volume to give some flow when initializing flow controller
   Reversed flow controller doesn't go up just because you increase the pressure on it
 5) microflow test now allows microflow pressure to go down and still save the data.
   The report program will have to accept this type of data file.  Also, the back pressure
   correction and pressure regulator increase now uses smaller steps because it was over
   correcting.
 6) New option to turn off regulator control during microflow test.  This is on the new
   microflow tab of the preferences screen.
 7) new file gasflowconversion.ini will be created if it is not there.  This will default to
   air/nitrogen as the only gas, with a conversion of 1.  If there is only one gas, the program
   will look the same as before.  If there is more than one gas, then an extra item will
   be on the main screen showing what gas is selected and you can use this to select a new
   gas.  The gas conversion factor will be used for all flow readings and parameters.
   The selection box has been modified to allow selection of gasses as well as group names.
   In doing this, the selection box has been updated so it preselects the existing group or
   gas name, except when deleteing a group in which case nothing is selected and the current
   group is not displayed (since you can't delete the current group).
 8) Piston is raised at end of microflow test.
 9) Slow vent at end of microflow test gives more information and delays a little more at the
   end to let the regulator go all the way down to 0 before venting the system fully.

6.70.47)
 Added a new code module, Statistics.bas, which contains functions for calculating mean and
  linear regression for data in a new structure, xy_data. Used this to add linear regression
  as an option to the pressure hold test (when determining pressure drop at the end of the test).
 Now storing the chamber volume, Chamber_Volume, in the .ini file during the microflow calibration.
 Added a new option under the Calibrate menu for doing this if you don't have microflow.
 Added volume leak information to the pressure hold test results, and also to the data file.
 Removed P02 (P0 squared), which was useless.

6.70.46)
 Safetydown variable takes priority over the door switch.  Autopiston used to assume a door switch, and the
  safetydown variable was ignored.  Now, if you have the safetydown turned on, it will ignore the door
  switch (if any) and use the safetykeypress form whenever you want to clamp the sample chamber.

6.70.45)
 Replaced Show_Result and start_caprep variables with auto_report_type (but left them in for version
  compatibility). User can now choose to automatically run a report at the end of a test, or just run the
  summary sheet or equivalent. Per KG's request, the old "show results at end of test" option is now hidden
  because the results do not agree with caprep's calculations.
 Corrected a bug in the "fail by absolute pressure change" pressure hold option.
 Changed the format of the BP debug log.                                    -- MJLC 4/23/03

6.70.44)
 Minor corrections to the writing of the pressure hold test data file.      -- MJLC 4/17/03

6.70.43)
 Replaced the call to automatically start Caprep at the end of a test, which disappeared under
  mysterious circumstances.  Also fixed a bug which caused a crash when changing the liquid name for a
  permeability test. -- MJLC 4/15/03

6.70.42)
 Added a debug log to the bubble point routine - activated by debugBP=Y in capwin.ini -- MJLC 4/10/03
 Fixed a bug created in 6.70.37 where line26 was not updated properly and BP routine misbehaved for
  machines with a low flow controller.

6.70.41)
 Modified the pressure hold test to save hold rate unit information (PSI, PSI/sec, PSI/min, etc)
  at the end of the data file.
 Pass/fail test: changed the background color on the label in the progress screen for better contrast.
  Added the coveted smiley and frowny faces. Also moved the pass/fail check slightly so that it fits
  better into the main BP loop.                 -- MJLC 4/2/03 (one whole year at PMI...)

6.70.40)
 Microflow test now lowers pressure slowly so that there is no shock to the sample.
  The internal pressure is lowered to keep it no more than the initial holding pressure
  below the microflow pressure to allow the pressure in the microflow pressure volume to
  go back through the sample.  Once the microflow pressure is less than the initial
  hold pressure, it is save to zero the pressure in the chamber and then vent the system.
  If you are using a high pressure for your test, this will have no effect.  This will
  only do something if you are running a low pressure (like 1 PSI) test and the microflow
  pressure chamber builds up beyond 1 PSI (which would make the forward pressure above 2
  PSI).
 Removed check for flow meter off scale during main equilibrium routine - this will allow
  low flow samples that have high flow rates initially after every pressure increment to
  have time for the flow to go back down.  If the stable flow is still above the maximum
  flow rate then the test will stop.  Note that you will have to increase the equilibrium
  iterations to a large number to give the system more time for the flow to drop.

6.70.39)
 Added current lohm table to parameters saved in the data file.
 Fixed a bug in the pressure hold test converting /sec to /min.     -- MJLC 3/26/03

6.70.38)
 For reversed flow controllers, the pressure regulator now increases as the bubble
  point test goes along so that we keep a fairly constant delta-p accross the
  flow controller.
 The maximum bubble point differential pressure is now derated depending on the
  atmospheric pressure.  At two atmospheres (absolute pressure) the bubble point
  differential pressure will be divided by 2.

6.70.37)
 Fixed flow controller pressure increase routine so it doesn't trigger just due to
  noisy flow readings - the flow reading must stay below the target for 10 seconds
  before it will try to increase the pressure.

6.70.36)
 Removed some test code that accidentally got saved into the program. -- MJLC 3/20/03

6.70.35)
 Internal pressure during microflow test is now corrected for the back pressure
 If internal pressure falls too low, the regulator will increase to compensate.

6.70.34)
 Made a few minor adjustments to the elevated liquid perm routine.  -- MJLC 3/13/03

6.70.33)
 Now always writes the tortuosity value to the data file during a test (previously only if not default).
 Set the font properties of the entire manual control and testscrn forms to alleviate the scrolling/wrapping problem.
 Added a new user preference for the minimum time between data points in liquid perm (previously hard-coded to
  0.2 seconds).
 In the elevated liqperm test, added the mintime criterion and decreased the min. step from 1/20 DAC to 2.5%  -- MJLC 3/10/03

6.70.32)
 Fiddled with the new liquid perm routine a bit more; added the new timer to the elevated
  perm routine.                                 -- MJLC 2/28/03

6.70.31)
 The zerotime parameter is now always set to 10 seconds for version 7 with
  low flow controllers.  This parameter was previously not used in version 7
  (it was used in version 6 and before) and then was used again to control the
  timing of the low flow controller reset procedure.  The default value of 1
  second (for version 6 and before) was too small for this new use in version
  7 and we don't want to have to make everyone change this parameter for version
  7 so it is now hard-coded at 10 seconds and the parameter that the user can change
  is now ignored.  Users who had set this to 10 seconds should set it back to the
  default of 1 second in case it gets used for something in the future.
 Also: Internal pressure during microflow test is now corrected for the back pressure

6.70.30)
 Continued improvements to the pressure hold test. Fixed a problem with the pass/fail calculation and improved
  the seconds/minutes selection.
 New method of doing liquid perm test:
  added Ron's new implementation of the "performance counter" method of timing -- support for QueryPerformanceCounter
  and QueryPerformanceFrequency in "kernel32" dll; also added Ron's new function, time_difference, for finding the time
  in seconds between two consecutive calls to QueryPerformanceCounter. These are now used for recording the critical time at which
  the height and pressure are recorded in the liquid perm routine.
 Corrected a bug in the translation strings where "low pressure gauge" was mapped to "low flow"

6.70.29a) (Special version)
 Includes first 5 changes in 6.70.29. Changed time to wait between points in
  liq. perm tests from 0.2 to 1 s; disabled press. hold in Preferences tab since it is not yet completed.

6.70.29)
 More change requests from Haemonetics:  Ripped apart QC mode and redid the interface.
 Pressure hold tests: Added option to fail based on absolute pressure change instead of pressure/time.
 Redid the averaging method used: now takes as many readings as user wants and averages them to obtain a single point.
 Removed the subroutine Hold_Key(), since all it did was call DoEvents.
 Added a debugging log for elev. liq. perm, set by debugh20perm in capwin.ini. - saves pressure and height
 Rearranged the preferences for the pressure hold test and pulled some options from the test setup screen to the preferences
  window.
 In the liquid perm test, changed the minimum time between samples from 0.2 to 1 sec to reduce noise in the height readings. May
  want to make this variable later.

6.70.28)
 Added support for "reverse_flow_controller".
 Added min and max logging of pressure gauge in manual control for debugging purposes

6.70.27)
 Microflow porometry test now subtracts microflow pressure (back pressure on sample) from internal
  pressure so that we use the proper differential pressure for the test.

6.70.26)
 Discovered that the data editor window was much too large to fit on an 800x600 screen! Dunno
   how I missed that one. Managed to squeeze it in by rearranging everything on it.
 Reworked the pressure hold test again at the behest of Dr. Gupta and the Haemonetics people. Sampling rate is
  now variable. Progress screen shows and records averaged data, not raw data. Test does not automatically fail
  if pressure falls too much; instead, it's linked in to the pass/fail option in the test selection window.

6.70.25)
 Microflow calibration for air-top machines is now working.
 Pressure hold test now uses regulator calibration table (for new machines) to set the initial
  pressure faster.
 There is now a delay after the minimum bubble point pressure is reached before the bubble point
  test starts to let things stabilize better.
 There is now a delay after the first pass before the second pass starts if they are not going to
  be prompted to load the sample.
 Hid the "Set Valve Limits" menu option.
 Reworked the reworking of the lohm table setup. A lohm table pathname is now stored for each user. When
  the program starts or a different user is selected, the lohm table at that pathname is copied into the
  lohmtable.cal file in the main directory.  When a new lohm table is created, it is saved to the user's choice
  of filenames.  The lohmtable.cal file in the main directory is only a working file for the software and is overwritten
  each time the program starts up or the group is changed.

6.70.24)
 Removed procedure update_board_loc, since it was a one-liner only called from one place.
 Fixed a bug in display of comm ports in preferences window.
 Fixed a problem in the autoparm print routine caused by unpleasantly long filenames.
 Added checking for lohmtable.cal in capwin directory as well as user directories.      -- MJLC, 1/14/03
 Made the preferences window non-resizable.
 Disabled the section that would skip data points during the Lohm calibration if the readings were
  not stabilizing fast enough.  This was messing up on new faster version 7 instruments and skipping
  points that really should be taken.

6.70.23)
 Changed the run_elev_lqperm routine to handle problem with zero pressure.  (Ron)
 Enabled font changing and translation for a couple of lines in the manual control screen that I missed. Updated
  the language file with the new windows and text that have been added recently.
 Modified the pressure hold test to include a user-changeable averaging method (variable num_PH_AvePoints). Also modified
  the press.hold test display, changing the y-axis to scale out as the test progresses and adding two lines to indicate the edges
  of the "pass/no pass" region.
 Fixed a bug in opening the leak test file at the end of the test
 Changed the location of lohmtable.cal files so that they are now group-specific. Haven't changed the default directory
  for backup tables, though; still goes to \parms.  Added display of the current lohm table to the title screen                -- MJLC 1/10/03

6.70.22)
 Enabled automatic starting of CapRep at the end of a test (finally!). Modified the QC window to make it harder to
  select the wrong test.                                        -- MJLC 1/3/03

6.70.21)
 Bubble point test now starts at pressure differential specified by new capwin.ini parameter max_bp_pres_dif, which
  defaults to 20 PSI.  Also uses new low flow controller initialization.

6.70.20)
 For dual regulator systems, both pressure regulator calibration tables are now loaded at all times.  The proper table
  is used depending on which regulator is active.
 The proper regulator should be selected based on the maximum pressure for the test as set up on the test setup screen

6.70.19)
 Removed all code references to version 5.x hardware, the small inst. board form, win95io.dll, and Version 5-only subs.
 Made substantial changes to TitleScrn menus by collecting various options into a new window, prefsForm. Removed
  the setuplogging window, since the options are now in "prefs". Hopefully this will make things simpler
  for the user and present a cleaner-looking interface. Also updated the PMI logo in the main screen and removed the logo from cap_cur.frm.
 Also removed duplicate copies of update_linear_unit and update_thickness_unit functions from TitleScrn.
 Also added the ability to start CapRep with the current data file at the end of a test -- currently disabled because file does not load properly.
 Removed initialize_psr from capflow.bas, since it was a one-line function that was called exactly once.
 Modified the lohm calibration routine so that users can select the starting flow point (% of max. flow).
 Fixed a problem with the hidden label in the test screen - font wasn't getting changed along with the rest of the program, so
  long filenames weren't being displayed properly.  -- MJLC, 12/02
 Added in error trap in serial port error correction routine to stop possible
  endless loop if you get a specific type of communications error while reading
  the penetrometer.
 Added a routine to calibrate both regulators in a dual-regulator system when "calibrate regulator" is selected ... but it's currently
  disabled because it's not working properly yet.
 Added an option for the pressure hold test fail rate to be displayed in PU$/min instead of PU$/sec.

6.70.18)
 Added the capability to run looping tests for demonstrations. This is accessed by setting LoopingDemo=Y in
  capwin.ini and selecting the test type as usual in the software. There is no way for a user to set the
  LoopingDemo variable in the software. Also removed an undesirable "Yo!" message that I inadvertently
  left in the code.                         -- MJLC, 11/25/02

6.70.17)
 Stopped regulator from going too high at the end of the bubble point before
  the wet curve starts.  This could be caused if the regulator has a large
  zero offset, which would be doubled in the old program.  If the regulator
  if too high, the pressure would go up too fast when valve 2 was opened and
  you could skip some data points.
 Also removed a 0.6 second delay (two 0.3 second delays in a row) from the start
  of the test that were not needed.

6.70.16)
 Modified the leak test filename format to include date and time, so that multiple tests
  will not overwrite. Also changed the Lohm calibration to start at a higher flow rate.      -- MJLC, 11/1/02

6.70.15)
 Added debug button to progress screen that will bring up a small window that
  will show information about how the stability routines are doing.

6.70.14)
 Removed units of measurement from the translated .ini file. Also added a pass/fail
  test option based on bubble point -- parameters are in select_test. Also added a variable
  delay in the leak test routine before reading the initial pressure at each step. This should
  give the gauge time to stabilize before taking the reading. Set by read_delay in autoparm. -- MJLC 10/30/02

6.70.13)
 Added support for second regulator calibration file.  When using reg 2,
  the calibration file is now capwinrg2.cal.  This means you don't have to
  recalibrate when you switch regulators.
 Also fixed problem with i/p regulator at beginning of dry curve where it
  sometimes would not increase the regulator enough to get any flow until
  valve 2 was all the way open.

6.70.12)
 Added storage of last 100 transactions over the serial port to the debug log
 Also added checking of return values from version 7 machines to make sure
  they are in the right range so that an error character does not cause an
  overflow or other numeric or procedure error.
 Added error trapping to raw reading procedure to try to trap a very rare
  procedure call error.
 Fixed error in error trapping routine (!) that would cause the very rare
  procedure call error (left in the trap above).

6.70.11)
 Changed comm timout values to try to make system more stable on computers with slower
  comm ports.

6.70.10)
 Added log_comm to capwin.ini capstuff section.  If "Y", it will log the comm errors.
 Also removed auto crossover recalibration during the auto test because it was messing
  up with the lohm correction.

6.70.09)
 Added additional wait time for flow controller models (ver 7) if low flow meter
  is under counts - it could be because there was pressure in the flow controller
  and when valve 1 was opened this pressure went backwards through the valve and
  caused the flow meter to read negative.

6.70.08)
 Changed microflow calibration to use only 1.25 atm instead of 2 atm to make it run
  faster.
 Also changed parameter editor so it allows commas as well as decimal points.

6.70.07)
 Fixed microflow calibration for version 7 instruments.

6.70.06)
 Data averager completely rewritten. Now calculates an average CFF for the files, averages
  dry flow data, uses the two data sets to back-calculate wet flow data, and creates a file
  containing the averaged dry flow and calculated wet flow data.        -- MJLC 9/13/02

6.70.05)
 Microflow data files now have the viscosity of the gas stored in the same
  manner as the gas permeability data files.  This requires a change to caprep
  if you use a gas other than one of the standards.

6.70.04)
 Added function myVal(a$) which replaces the built-in val() function for cases where
  they could use a comma in place of a decimal point.

6.70.03)
 Fixed problem with long path names in test setup screen - they were not being
  shortened properly if they didn't fit in the box because the reference label that
  was used to determine how much space was available had been made wider.  There is
  now a reference label that remains hidden but that is used to determine the available
  width for any of the output boxes.

6.70.02) Added feature to keep appended log of the final results of all tests.
  This is stored by user, and uses the boolean variable uselog and the
  string variable logpath, both of which are stored with the user information.
  The default is to not use the log.  The log path is set in a new form.  This
  form could eventually be used for other user-specific information or
  settings.
 Also changed menu display of supervisor mode - there is now a "User Mode" menu
  item that is checked if you are in user mode.  Previously, when you clicked on
  "Supervisor Mode" it would toggle between Supervisor and User modes.  Now you have
  to click on "User Mode" to switch to User mode.  Clicking on a mode that is already
  selected will have no effect.  This is in response to a customer who wanted an
  indication of "User Mode" rather than just a "Supervisor Mode" menu item without a
  check mark next to it.  ("User Mode" now gets the check mark when you are in User mode.)

6.70.01) Modified font behavior of control buttons, which weren't showing characters
  properly in Japanese. Font name can now be changed along with other text in a form, but
  size and bold attributes remain the same. Also increased the size and spacing of many
  elements throughout the program to correctly display foreign text strings larger than their
  English equivalents.      -- MJLC, 7/25/02

6.70.0
  Started 7/8/02 - Converted to multi-lingual support by pulling text strings
  into an external file, CapWinLanguage.ini, and including Translation.bas in
  the project. (Note: CapWin uses TWO language files, CapWin and CapWin2.) - MJLC

6.69.06) Complete redo of manual control display - with all the new features
  the old picture was getting too complicated and didn't properly display
  some of the new configurations like topfill, liqpermonly, airtop integrity,
  etc.

6.69.05) I/P regulator calibration table is now used when increasing
  the pressure for the liquid permeability test, though it still waits
  for the pressure to be reached so that changes in the penetrometer level
  during the pressurization do not show up in the flow data.  (If it doesn't
  reach the target pressure, it will increment the regulator a little more,
  but it won't decrement the regulator if it is too high.)
 Also, the display now shows differential pressure in liquid perm tests
  as opposed to absolute pressures.

6.69.04) If penetrometer is in range before filling, it now assumes
  that the penetrometer is at least somewhat full and within normal
  range so it doesn't require that the penetrometer go through the
  lower half of the range before going properly to the upper half
  of the range.  (If the penetrometer starts out empty, it can get
  incorrect readings that may seem like a full penetrometer while the
  magnet makes the transition from off scale to in scale, so we make
  sure that the magnet travels through the lower half before we accept
  any readings in the upper half as being valid.  If the penetrometer
  is already in the upper half, then we would have to drain out some
  of the water first, and that is a pain to do, and can't be done
  easily in autofill machines.
 Also, on liquid permeameters with an autopiston (of which we have
  only made one) the autopiston doesn't come down until the penetrometer
  has been filled.

6.69.03) The capcal.d8a file is now ignored if you only have liquid
  permeability (there are no flow meters, so you can't create a
  capcal.d8a file, so there is no sense in trying to read in the
  file because if it is corrupt then you have no way of fixing it).

6.69.02) Added support for autofill valve in version 7 porometer
  this is feature number +512.  The topfill variable is not used in
  version 7

6.69.01) Added further error trapping to serial communications routine
  for unsupported read command.  If you send a read command that is not
  supported by the hardware, the hardware won't send anything back and
  the program will just loop back and try the command again.  Now, after
  10 retries, it will give you an error message and then return with a
  simulated reading.

6.69) Release version shipped 5-14-02

6.68.10) Added cancel button to some calls for safetykeypress
  if the piston is about to rise at the end of the test, you can't
  cancel it.
 Also, in the elevated pressure liquid permeability test, if you
  abort the test, it will force a data point (and then end the test)
  without waiting for the timer to finish counting.

6.68.09) Added safetydown and safetyup features for compression

6.68.08) Added starting pressure to condensation test

6.68.07) Fixed timer problem in auto test for condensation porometry.  Also added
  new condensation parameter "min_deltap" to control how long readings continue.

6.68.06) Added support for valve 20 (formerly the air top integrity valve, now
  the air top exhaust valve) for machines with liquid permeability, air top, and
  only one sample chamber.  Valve 20 needs to remain open most of the time and
  only close when you are doing liquid permeability.
 Also added support for version 7 compression regulator on analog output port 3.
  The compression regulator is not motorized in version 7 - it is another i/p
  converter.

6.68.05) Added lock for P0 value after bubble point is taken during wet curve
  This should prevent the report program from giving a value different from the
  testing program for the bubble point.

6.68.04) Added preliminary auto test for condensation test using liquid vapor system

6.68.03) Added support for 9th valve in liquid vapor permeameter.  You can still
  have lvperm_numvalves set to 8 and the 9th will show up.  (For now, you can use
  any number other than 5 and all 9 valves will show up.)

6.68.02) Fixed colors on analog calibration form so the text is always visible
  even with inverted color schemes.
 Also: Now scans com ports 1 through 9 and only puts those that are available
  in the menu.

6.68.01) Allow cyclic compression to also be used with autopiston machines

6.68) Release version shipped 3-21-02

6.67.08) Added more forced regulator increments when you are below the minimum
  pressure on the dry curve and have been opening valve 2.  This is all in an
  attempt to speed up the dry curve below the minimum pressure.
 Also changed final result value for bubble point so it shows 3 digits after the
  decimal - it had been only showing 2 digits, which was ok for a 100 PSI machine,
  but for a 500 PSI machine this wasn't enough.

6.67.07) Added compensation for noisy pressure gauges during the dry curve
  when you are lower than the minimum testing pressure.  This stops the noise
  on the pressure gauge from making the program think that the pressure is
  rising when in fact it is just jumping around.  (If it thinks the pressure is
  going up, it won't increase the pressure on the system and will take a long
  time to get to the minimum pressure - and we are trying to get to the minimum
  pressure as fast as possible.)

6.67.06) Added initial pressure regulator increment to lohm calibration for
  i/p regulators that have a non-zero starting point of the pressure
  regulator calibration table.  If the regulator has a high starting point,
  this could cause the lohm calibration routine to give up with no pressure
  increase.

6.67.05) Minimum lohm_ratio is changed from 1.1 to 1.01

6.67.04) Added manual control for 8-valve lvperm.  There is a new variable
  lvperm_numvalves, which is either 5 or 8.
 Also added lvperm manual pulsing routines when you click on the letter of the
  valve.  You control the pulse width using a slider that uses global variable
  lv_valve_pulse_timing.

6.67.03) The min_pressure use in the dry curve is now optional.  There is a check
  box in the execute menu and a variable in the user group.

6.67.02) Fixed low flow controller stabilization routine when using a non-zero
  minimum pressure for the bubble point test.

6.67.01) Renamed modes of testing to "QC" - replaces "Simple QC", "User" -
  replaced old "QC", "User" or "Normal", and "Supervisor"

6.67) Release version shipped 2-15-02
  Microflow calibration has been removed since a manual calibration at
  the factory is more accurate than the auto calibration by the software
  and the volumes shouldn't change unless the hardware is modified.

6.66.12) CalcGP rewritten to use the .cft data structure.  (It had been giving
  incorrect results.)  It currently only supports darcy calculations.  Other
  calculations will follow later.

6.66.11) Pressure is now displayed while pressurizing but below minimum pressure

6.66.10) Added extra increase to pressure regulator if we are below the minimum
  pressure (and so are not waiting for stability) but opening of valve 2 doesn't
  seem to be increasing the pressure any.

6.66.09) Fixed possible problem where pressure regulator would be incremented
  too much during estimated bubble point setting routine
  Also added support for minimum pressure in dry curve when going up

6.66.08) Added support for valve 20 for an air-top microflow.

6.66.07) Added in Howard's fix for the parameter saving routine
  Also added darcy calculation to end of test report for liquid
  permeability.

6.66.06) Changed display method for results at end of test.  Sometimes
  it could choose the wrong display format resulting in strange looking
  results.

6.66.05) Fixed overflow that could happen if your regulator was not
  calibrated all the way to the maximum pressure for the test and it
  had to extrapolate the table to get the count value for the maximum
  pressure.  Now, the program will not try to use a count value for
  the regulator higher than the maximum calibated count value.

6.66.04) Various buttons have been renamed and/or moved to make things
  look more standard.  Forms with OK and Cancel now all respond to
  "Enter" for OK and "Esc" for Cancel.  Other buttons all have
  keyboard shortcuts for them.  Ampersands can now be put in group names
  and sample IDs and other places and they will show up properly (rather
  then showing up as underlines).  This should make companies like
  P&G and H&V happy.

6.66.03) Group names are now always called "Group" - they were sometimes
  called "User" or "User Group", which was confusing when describing
  supervisor/user/qc modes of operation.

6.66.02) You can now set the pressure regulator increments less than 1
  (but no less than 0.02) for version 7 since this parameter is
  multiplied by 50 for an I/P converter

6.66.01) Fixed integrity test for version 7 instruments.

6.66) Release version shipped 1-8-02

6.65.14) Changed mapping of high flow meters 1 and 2 in version 7.  In
  older versions, if there was only one high flow meter it was called
  "high" and mapped to channel hflow1.  If there were two high flow meters,
  the largest was called "extra high" and mapped to channel hflow2 and
  the other was called "high" and mapped to channel hflow1.  Since a single
  high flow meter is usually the same range as the "extra high" in a dual
  high flow meter system, this naming was changed in version 7 so that a
  single high flow meter is called "high" and mapped to the "high2" channel
  and with a dual flow meter system the largest flow meter is called "high"
  and is still mapped to the "high2" channel and the smaller flow meter is
  called "medium" and is mapped to the "high1" channel.

6.65.13) Added cyclic compression to the execute menu for those who have
  an autocompression feature

6.65.12) Fixed caption on penetrometer fill count targets to reflect
  version 7 hardware count range.  Also changed initial setup stability
  criteria for zero flow settings because of version 7 higher resolution.

6.65.11) Openv2pos now makes sure that the valve only opens
  and Move2v2pos now makes sure that the valve only closes.  This stops
  incorrect valve movement if the target byte is sent incorrectly
  due to a communications problem.

6.65.10) Modified communications error trapping to avoid a possible
  software hang.

6.65.09) Added support for time logging of data points if use_time=Y

6.65.08) Added manual data logging option to liquid vapor manual control

6.65.07) Added support for special autopiston clamping machine
  Set "autopiston" to "Y" to enable.  Can't also have
  autocompress turned on.  Must have special hardware or it won't
  do anything.  Also enables door switch which won't allow piston
  to clamp unless cover is closed to prevent pinching fingers
  Saved testing parameters and software version number at end of test.

6.65.06) Fixed some timing problems with new equilibrium routine
  introduced in 6.65.04.
 Also, Preginc is now multiplied by 50 for version 7 because 20 was
  not enough.

6.65.05) For version 7, the I/P converter is set to the maximum pressure
  for the test at the beginning of the bubble point routine.  Previously,
  the pressure on the regulator was kept slightly higher than the pressure
  in the sample chamber, but this rising pressure (as the pressure in the
  chamber rises) was causing false flow readings on the flow controller
  and messing up the bubble point test for low flow rates (3cc/min).

6.65.04) Parameters are now independent of version and computer speed.
  Slew count parameters are now multiplied by 3 for version 7 (new
  ver1or3 variable).  Preginc is multiplied by 20 for version 7.
  Eqiter and Aveiter are now in 0.1 seconds (though the special cases
  of 0 and 1 are still usable).  The parameter editor screen reflects
  these changes and allows non-integer values.
 Also, fixed problem with initializing the system with the i/p converter
  for the second half of a DUWU or WUDU test - valve 11 may have been
  opened before the pressure in the system had bled off enough so the
  fail-safe procedure in the instrument would have closed the valve
  again.  The valve 11 opening has been moved to after valve 2 is closed
  and valve 11 is again set in the "load sample" routine just to make
  sure.
 Also, a 3 second delay at the end of the "initialize system" routine
  was removed because it probably did nothing but make test setup
  take longer.  It was originally put in the QBasic code so that a
  display message would stay on the screen long enough to read it.

6.65.03) Changed version 7 protocol so return values are now 6 bits.
  This makes the return values all printable characters and eliminates
  the problem with null return values messing up the sync.  This was
  originally implemented in l3perm.  This means that return values that
  were already 1 byte printable character are unchanged but that return
  values that are 1 byte binary are now returned as two characters and
  normal analog readings that are 2 bytes binary are returned as three
  characters.  There are two new version dependent global variables to
  make this a little easier.  Ver2or3 is set to 2 for version 6 and 3 for
  version 7.  Ver1or2 is set to 1 for version 6 and 2 for version 7.
  The debugcom routines do their own binary input and do not use this
  method, but since the goal is to minimize com errors when using the
  normal testing routines and to maximize the error detection when using
  the com testing routines, this is fine.

6.65.02) Added system_font variable and selectfont form to allow user to
  set the font to use for all forms.  This should allow users in countries
  that use non-ascii characters to properly enter their own values.
 Also added support for saving a named .cal file for the lohm table
  and re-loading the named file to overwrite the lohmtable.cal file.
  Named lohm table .cal files are stored in the parms directory so we
  don't have to make a new subdirectory.
 Also changed all GPPS calls that return strings to use a null trim
  function and not use the returned length of the string.  GPPS returns
  an incorrect length (too long) if the return value contains multi-
  byte characters (such as Japanese or Chinese), and this padded the
  string with extra null characters which messed up string handling
  functions.  This showed up in path names in the file selector.

6.65.01) "Please Wait" form now doesn't show if you are just saving your
  test setup and not actually running a test.

6.65) Final version shipped on 10-01-01

6.64.21) Added simple QC mode - displays user groups and automatically
  runs the default test in that group with no prompts.

6.64.20) Fixed problem with first data point of gas permeametry being
  overcorrected by a high lohm value - would most likely happen with
  surface area testing.

6.64.19) Manual control of liquid vapor now correctly closes valve E
  when it starts up.  (Otherwise, if you left valve E open and closed
  from manual control, when you re-entered the screen would show the
  valve closed when it was in fact open.  If you then clicked on it,
  it would either close and the display would continue to show it closed
  or it would stay open and the display would then show it open.

6.64.18) Fixed problem introduced in version 6.64.16 that would cause
  a subscript error on all tests that did not use the temperature
  probe (even if there was no temperature probe in the instrument).
  The feature to remember the testing temperature was also triggering
  the use_temperature variable incorrectly so it always thought that
  there was a temperature probe being used.

6.64.17) microflow porometry now doesn't need the pressure gauge to be set
  with a zero value of 0 - you can set the zero value to 14.7 so that it
  reads absolute pressure correctly and it will still work.

6.64.16) First letter of alternative fluid name was being messed up - this
  is now fixed.
 Also, testing temperature for liquid permeability is now remembered (for
  those few machines that have this feature).
 Also, liquid permeability default values now show up without the leading
  space and are fully selected to make it easier to change them.

6.64.15) Allow autofill liquid permeability test to take up to 5 minutes for
  the initial fill before giving up (autofill has to fill the entire sample
  chamber, so it can take longer for the penetrometer to get in range).
 Also, the prompt at the end of the autofill has been changed to make it
  clearer.

6.64.14) Fixed manual control for topfill autofill machines - it was still
  indexing the drain valve as valve 12 when it was in fact valve 3.
 Also fixed manual control when temperature controller was turned on -
  the temperature text box was sending keypresses to the form, but the form
  already had seen them because of the preview feature turned on, so some
  keypresses were being processed twice whenever the cursor was in the
  temperature setting text box.

6.64.13) Machines with solenoid valve 2 (WESA) now can run a lohm calibration.

6.64.12) Added support for new valve E in manual control of liquid vapor

6.64.11) Apply 1/20 span offset to open limit so that we don't have the
  problem in manual control of having the valve stop at 99.5% open.  This
  offset was used in the older version 5 machines, but never added to the
  version 6 machines until now because you could always change the limit in
  the ini file, but now the program automatically re-reads the open limit
  (and the close limit) every time the instrument is initialized.

6.64.10) User settings now remember if you want to show results at the end
  of the test.

6.64.08) If your output data file has the name "do not save data file.cft"
  then the data file will not be saved.  (If there actually exists a file
  with this name, you will not be asked if you want to overwrite it unless
  you select it again in the file selector since the file selector has a
  a built-in prompt for overwriting existing files, but the capwin program
  will not add an extra prompt when you start the test.  The existing file
  will not be modified.)  The lastdata.cft file will still be written with
  the data from the last test run.

6.64.07) Fixed problem where gas permeability test wasn't saving the
  information about which gas was selected - it would always default to air.

6.64.06) Improved low flow controller initialization so it works better at
  low flow rates (such as 2 cc/min).  It was giving false bubble points.

6.64.05) Maximum count and interation values are now higher in version 7

6.64.04) Dry down now works better in version 7.  The regulator will
  be decreased steadily, and at the same time valve 2 will be closed
  in amounts that will bring it to fully closed by the time the regulator
  reaches 0.
 Also: Fixed problem with pressure rising too much when the low pressure
  gauge goes off scale so fast that there is no time to do the automatic
  crossover calculation - if this happened during normal equilibrium then
  the program would keep incrementing the pressure (opening valve 2 and/or
  increasing the pressure regulator) until the low range of the high pressure
  gauge reached the same count value as the previous good reading of the
  count value of the high range of the low pressure gauge.

6.64.01) Added communications debugging commands for serial port on hardware
  version 7 machines.  This should give us information on the latency of the
  serial port and be able to test transmit and receive independently and give
  reliable statistics on how the serial port is working.

6.64) released 7-5-01

6.63.10) airtop integrity now works with integrity porometry testing.  If
  the maximum flow rate parameter is set at or below the range of the
  integrity flow meter, then variable integrity_porometry is set to true
  and during the porometry (and gas permeability) test instead of reading
  the high flow meter it will read the integrity flow meter.

6.63.9) Added support for valve 20 - this is for new airtop systems with
  an integrity flow meter.  Valve 20 stays open at the bottom of the air
  sample chamber unless you want to divert the flow through the integrity
  flow meter, and then valve 20 closes so all the flow has to go back
  up inside the cabinet to the integrity flow meter.  This is activated
  when airtop and integrity are both true.
 Also - when you click on the integrity flow meter on an airtop machine,
  if valve 20 is already closed, it will open valve 20 and stop reading
  then itegrity flow meter.  (Previously, you had to click on the low flow
  meter.)
 Also - valve 2 limits are now automatically updated every time the machine
  initializes.  You no longer need to do the calibration manually, though
  you still can (it will let you know that you don't need to do this.)
  This only applies to version 6 and higher machines.  For version 5.31 and
  lower you still need to do the valve limit calibration whenever you change
  valve 2 (and the calibration message doesn't tell you that you don't have
  to do the calibration).

6.63.8) Chamber selection can now be done in user mode - it was previously
  restricted to supervisor mode.  The chamber selection is now done using
  a new form, rather than being in the menu, as this makes it much easier
  to set chambers.
 Also: New groups will inherit default parameters from current group.  This
  wouldn't work if you selected a different group and then created a new group
  without running a test first - the selection of a group was not loading in
  the default parameters until the next test was run, so when the new group
  was created it would get its parameters from either the group that was current
  when the program was started, or the parameters from the last test that had
  had been run.

6.63.7) Gauge range changes in manual control are now delayed until after
  the current reading is finished.  This fixes a slight problem where
  the next reading would be messed up when you clicked to change the range
  of a gauge.  The count value would be for the previous range but the
  calculated value would use that old count value with the new range.

6.63.6) I/P converter now has pressure regulator calibration enabled.

6.63.5) Fixed problem where if you have only one high flow meter it would be
  possible to get an error message saying that hflow% was set to 2 (it should
  only be set to 0 or 1 for one high flow meter) at the beginning of the test
  if you run the test after running a lohm calibration.  If you restart the
  program after running the lohm calibration you will not see this problem.
  The Lohm calibration function was leaving a variable set incorrectly, and
  the load sample function was assuming that the variable was set properly.
 Also set the lohm value when the lohm table is zero length to 0.  This will
  solve the problem when there is a large sample chamber with a very low
  pressure gauge mounted in the chamber (for gas permeability tests) and there
  is no pressure drop measurable during the lohm test.

6.63.4) When you select advanced settings for one test it would now reverts
  back to the simplified settings for the start of the next test.  Before,
  it would sometimes stay on advanced settings.  This broke in 6.62.06.
  This problem was caused by a variable local to the form retaining its value
  even after the form was unloaded and then loaded in again.  The program
  assumed that the variable would be cleared by the unload process and when it
  wasn't it assumed that the form had already been loaded and didn't bother to
  reset the advanced view to the default value.  There is now a global variable
  that is set by the routine that calls the testing screen to let it know that
  this is the first call for a given test.

6.63.3) Preliminary support finished for version 7 hardware - auto testing
  and calibration should all work now.
 Also: low flow calibration is stored in capcal.tmp while it is being done
  and it is only copied over to capcal.d8a when it finished correctly.

6.63.2) CAPWIN.INI new option: preloaded_sample=Y means that we can assume
  that the sample is already loaded and don't have to ask for anything to
  start the test after the press "Start" on the test setup menu.

6.63.1) Valve testing ("t" in manual control) will now only work if you
  enter a positive number for the number of times to test valve 2.  It
  used to have a default value of 100, which would be used if you cancelled
  the number input box, and would also allow 0 for a valid number of tests.
 Also: Pressure unit menu now has a check mark next to the current unit.
 Also: Tab orders fixes for some forms to make it easier to use keyboard
  to set up testing.  Some more alt-key shortcuts added as well.
 Also: Now remembers last settings for leak test, curve fitting, and elevated
  pressure liquid permeability.  These are remembered independently for each
  user.
 Also: Data editor now knows if the current file has been modified and warns
  you when you try to exit the form or load a new file if you haven't saved
  the changed data.
 Also: MFP is now reported at end of porometry test (if they want data)

Version 6.63 released 6-12-01

6.62.07) Fixed problem where dry curve sample load would always prompt
  for loading even in multiple runs.  This affected dry up/wet up, and
  gas permeability.

6.62.06) Test setup screen now properly skips unselected chambers.  It had
  been showing setup screen for all chambers between the lowest selected
  and the highest selected, but it will now skip unselected chambers in
  the middle (such as 1, 3, 4).

6.62.05) User is now always prompted to put in saturated sample in the
  middle of a dry up/wet up test with multiple chambers, but is not
  prompted to put a dry sample in the next chamber because that is
  assumed to have already happened.

6.62.04) Fixed problem where bubble point would sometimes be skipped in
  multiple chamber testing.

6.62.03) Load chamber message box now tells you which chambers you are using.
  and if you abort a test you will then get the low sample message for the
  next chamber.  (If you don't abort, the next chamber will start automatically.)

6.62.02) Fixed problem where multi-unit tests were pausing to ask user to
  install sample in next chamber - user should only be asked at beginning
  to install samples in all chambers, and should only be asked at the very
  end to remove all samples (except for cases where there is large amounts
  of sample preparation, such as for liquid permeability testing).

6.62.01) Fixed display problem in multi-unit instruments when the first
  unit is not selected - the test setup screen was not being initialized
  properly.
 Also fixed problem where bubble point would be skipped on subsequent units

Version 6.62 released 5-31-01

6.61.11) Data editor now correctly saves files with moved dry curves.

6.61.10) Lohm table now has a third column for the low pressure gauge
  if there is a low pressure gauge.

6.61.09) Testing of parameter files now doesn't give false error if a parameter
  file is invalid but the type of test being performed doesn't use this parameter
  file.

6.61.08) Fixed multi-chamber lohm calibration - may also have affected running
  the lohm calibration more than once without shutting down the program.

6.61.07) When starting a test, the program now makes sure that the parameter
  files exist - if they don't (because of a network problem or removed directory
  or some other reason) then you will be warned (as opposed to having the program
  crash).  If the parameter file is no longer available when the program needs to
  open it, there will also be a warning message.
 Also, at the end of the test, if it can't copy the temporary data file over to
  where you said you wanted it, it will not crash but will ask you where to put
  the file and try again.
 Also: the "autocrossover.txt" file will only be created if the variable
  "crossoverdebug=Y" is in the capwin.ini file.

6.61.06) Added 2 second delay when closing valve 12 on a lowered penetrometer
  system during an elevated pressure test.  This may help with air getting
  below the sample for this unusual "water from the bottom" test.
 Also: Temporary creation of autocrossover.txt file when pressure gauge
  range changes and crossover is recalculated.

6.61.05) Speed up old hardware analog converter (version 5.31) - it was delaying
  longer than it needed to to wait for analog signals to settle.
 Also: If there is a path name in the command line to the executable, this will
  be used as the path to the capwin.ini file.  If there is no path name, or there
  is no capwin.ini file at the path name, then the normal procedure will be used.
  This makes it easier to run the interpreted version from any path.
 Also: On multi-chamber systems with compression, the compression feature
  is only used for chamber 1 - other chambers are normal.  This may have to
  change if we ever make a multi-chamber system where there is compression
  on more than just chamber 1.
 Also: On multi-chamber systems, the lohm calibration will only use those chambers
  that are currently selected, and generate a lohmtable.cal file for each
  chamber (with a number inserted before the ".cal" for chambers 2+).
  When a test is run, the proper lohm table will be loaded for each chamber.
  If a table is not found for the current chamber, the program will try to use
  the one for the previous chamber and keep going back until it reaches chamber
  1, which uses the default lohm table which must be there.

6.61.04) Fixed overflow problem if you used a sample ID (or other text input line)
  that could be evaluated to a very large number (like 3e456).

6.61.03) Added support for 5 chamber sequential instrument

6.61.02) Fixed subscript out of range error when logging lohm values

6.61.01) New variable max_liq_pres stores the maximum liquid permeability pressure
   default is 200 PSI (which was previously hard coded).

Version 6.61 released 4-29-01

6.60.19 Updated some things from Jeff - you can now abort the lohm calibration

Release versions will now only use the first two version places
The third version place will be 0 on released versions.  Modifications
to released versions will use the third place, and when the modifications
are complete the third place will be reset to 0 and the second place will
be incremented by one.

6.60.21 fixed parameter file printout problem - also moved parameters around
   so that maximum pressure is now in a special part since it is no longer
   used for testing and is only used for lohm calibration when there are two
   regulators.

Version 6.60.0 started 1-24-01 first version in vb6

1) By using VB6 and native code compile, the program runs faster

2) Changed from CV to Lohm calculations - improves correction of
   high flow/low pressure samples

3) Added "Prefilled" button to penetrometer fill routine that bypasses
   the check for initial fill.  This is needed when the penetrometer is
   already filled before you start the test.  The initial fill check
   requires that the penetrometer count value is greater than 10,000
   before it starts reading anything.  This was put in to fix the problem
   with false readings of full when the magnet is just entering the range
   of the penetrometer.

4) In elevated pressure liquid permeability, we won't increment the regulator
   for the first two data point faster than once every 1 second.  This should
   stop the pressure from rising too fast.

5) You can now abort a microflow test while the pressure is initializing

6) The pressure target is now displayed during elevated pressure liquid
   permeability while the regulator is being incremented.  This is for
   debugging purposes and may be removed later.

7) Fixed problem where elevated pressure liquid permeability test would
   record an inaccurately high atmospheric pressure before you actually
   start the test and then because of this not take any data at really
   low pressures at the beginning of the test.

8) If they have a bottom fill penetrometer (the pen20500 value is negative)
   then the drain valve (12) is not really a drain valve but is a chamber
   isolation valve between the chamber and the penetrometer.  In this case,
   we want to leave this valve closed at the end of the test so we don't drain
   out all the liquid from the chamber so they can run another test easily.
   For now, this valve will have to be opened in manual control if they really
   want to drain things out.

9) All output data files are now initially written to the file LASTDATA.CFT
   in the same directory as the executable program.  When the test is finished,
   this file is copied over to the actual output file that the user requested.
   The LASTDATA.CFT file remains so if they can't find their output file they will
   at least be able to recover the last test data.  This is also needed for high
   security situations where the raw data file is written to a non-modifiable
   disk partition so it can't be modified after the run is over.

10) For bottom fill penetrometer, at the end of an elevated pressure test it will
   now close valve 12 before venting the penetrometer and also wait 2 seconds
   for the valve (usually an air operated ball valve) to fully close.

11) In preparation for version 7 hardware support, all references to absolute
   count values have been removed.  The variables DAC_x are now set based on the
   hardware version.
   DAC_under = the minimum count value possible (1 for version 6 and 0 for version 7).
   DAC_over = the maximum count value possible (23000 for version 6, 65535 for version 7).
   DAC_zero = the normal count value for zero volts (500 for version 6, 2000 for version 7).
   DAC_two = the normal count value for 2 volts (20500 for version 6, 62000 for version 7).
   DAC_span = DAC_two-DAC_zero (20000 for ver. 6, 60000 for ver. 7)
   All references to the feature number should be inside the routine that reads the capwin.ini
   file.  This should set all booleans based on the feature number.  The bits in the feature
   number has changed slightly between versions 6 and 7, so haveing the decoding take place
   in one place will make things easier for the future.  The "feature" variable is now local
   to this procedure, while a new variable "capwin_feature_number" is used to store
   the feature number that is read in so it can be compared with the actual hardware feature
   number when communications is established with the instrument.  Do not use this new global
   variable in determining which hardware features are available anywhere outside the capwin.ini
   reading routine.
   While doing this, variables that should have been boolean but were integer because they
   were introduced in an older version of the language that did not have boolean variables
   have now been converted to booleans.  String variables that only held two possible values
   (such as "Y" and "N") have also been converted.  Strings that had three possibile values,
   such as "Y" for yes, "N" for no, and "E" for exclusive, have been converted into two
   booleans - one for enable and one for exclusive.

12) Fixed bug where program would crash with a type mismatch if you clicked on the "Edit Parameter
   File" button and the current focus was not on either the wet or dry parameter file and both
   the wet and dry parameter files were visible and they pointed to different parameter files.

13) Converted all variables that can hold count values from integer to long - this is so they will
   work with the version 7 hardware that returns count values between 0 and 65535.

14) Feature number on version 7 hardware always has the highest bit set.  Version 6 always has
   the highest bit clear.  Some version 6 hardware (old) may not have a feature number, and this
   has been allowed, but all version 7 hardware must have a feature number or it will not work.
   This will alert you if you connect the wrong machine to the serial port.

15) The CalibBoard form no longer uses a timer - it now reads as fast as it can.  It also has the
   capability of reading only one of the two calibration values (+2 and gnd) so you can make sure
   the reading is stable.  On version 7 you can also set the delay and averaging settings for the
   most steady signal.  These delay and averaging settings are now stored in the capwin.ini and
   updated when the instrument is initialized.

16) Added statistics for how fast the analog readings are coming in to the
   timer in the manual control window

17) Removed "ga" protocol for version 7 to solve serial port latency problem.  Modern serial ports
   do not need this protocol, which was implemented to get around single byte buffers in older pc
   serial ports.  Now that version 7 hardware is so much faster than version 6 that the latency of
   the serial port is making a big difference.  (It makes a small difference in version 6.)  Baud rate
   changed from 9600 for version 6 to 19200 for version 7.  (These changes may be removed if they
   cause any problems with communications.  Because of these changes, the feature number high bit
   mentioned in 14 above will have no effect since if you try to communicate with a version 7 machine
   and the software thinks it is a version 6 machine it won't work due to the communication speed and
   protocol differences.)

18) New boolean low_flow_controller if the low flow meter is actually a controller.  This is default
   in hardware version 7 and never present in hardware version 6.

Version 6.54.48 work in progress started 11-20-00 - no final version released because we switched to vb6

1) Moved release of compression pressure at the end of the test until
   after the regulator is zeroed and vent valve is opened.

2) Valve 1 is now opened during the excersize valve 2 routine.  This
   will help vent any high pressure gas between valve 1 and the needle
   valve that would otherwise have to go through the needle valve
   and low flow meter, which would cause the low flow meter to take
   longer to stabilize during the initial zeroing.

3) Estimated bubble point can now be done with elevated pressure bubble
   flow.

4) The bubble point test is timed from when the sample is first loaded to
   when the bubble point is recorded.  This time interval is reported along
   with the bubble point on the status line.

5) Added leak test to liquid vapor perm evacuation routine - pressure must
   not go up by more than 0.1 torr in 10 seconds or the test will not start.

6) Modified caption of new user units conversion factor entry form to make
   it clearer which conversion factor you should use (which is the amount in
   your new unit that is equal to 1 PSI).

7) The curve fit routine now lets files have flow values that
   are going the wrong way.

Version 6.54.47 11-17-00

1) Added support for experimental liquid vapor permeability test
   using two auxillary pressure gauges and four valves
   This is enabled by the lvperm_enable boolean set in the ini file
   The two pressure gauges are calibrated with aux_p1_span and
   aux_p2_span, which both default to 100 torr.
   The lvperm_enable is set to "E" in the ini file, then it is
   an exclusive lvperm with no other capflow features

2) The debug button for storing raw data with a pressure increment is
   now turned on by the debug_button_enable boolean in the ini file.

3) Added support for liquid permeameter with hydrohead - looks like a
   bubble point tester (with low flow meter and solenoid valve 2) but
   also has a penetrometer.  Does not have valve 4 since there is no
   way to send the pressure to the bottom of the sample chamber.  This
   type of machine can not run bubble point tests, but can run hydro-
   head tests.

4) Added support for I/P converter controlled regulator - feature 2048
   boolean variable ip_reg_enable - works with cv calibration, flow
   flow calibration, and gas permeability.  Other functions not tested
   yet.

5) Improved transition between bubble point and wet curve - on some systems
   it would hang up while lowering the pressure regulator

Version 6.54.46 10-6-00

1) Modified release of sample for high pressure liquid permeability
   test when using an automated compression system - it now releases
   the air pressure on the liquid first and then lifts up the compression
   piston - it was causing leaks around the sample chamber at the end of
   the test for high pressure testing.

2) Fixed problem in data editor when you tried to import a dry or wet
   curve with fewer data points than the current curve it would mess up.

Version 6.54.45 10-2-00

1) Fixed bug in curve fit routine where if the dry curve (coming down)
   stopped too early it could eliminate some of the wet curve data points.

2) When running dry up / wet up porometry test, the bubble point pressure
   would incorrectly be reported with the label "Hydrohead Pressure"
   on the testing screen - this is now fixed.  (The data would be correct,
   only the label would be wrong.)

3) Added supervisor variable - when true ("Y" in INI file, which is default -
   everything is normal.  When false ("N"), all complicated things are hidden
   so you can only do the default test in any of the groups.

4) When you close the test setup screen (with the "CLOSE" button, not with
   the "X" box) you are now allowed to save the changes you may have made to
   the test setup.  This allows you to pre-set things without actually running
   a test.

5) Test Setup Screen changed to allow selection of which items are shown
   in QC mode, no more double-clicking (single click will do), takes up less
   room (won't go off screen on small monitors), all user information now moved
   to a common routine, etc..

6) Moved subroutines that are common to both the control and report programs
   into a common module.  This will make updating both programs easier.

7) Data File Editor updated so it will work with all data file types.  It now
   uses the common files and cfttype data structure.

8) Pressure hold test now uses the dry parameters line in the test setup
   screen to hold the pressure and testing time, plus the new parameters for
   initial delay time and maximum rate of pressure drop (for pass/fail report)

Version 6.54.44 7-17-00

1) Added reg_zero_time to capwin.ini - defaults to 8 seconds.

2) End of external Hydrohead test can now be triggered with space bar

3) CV Interpolation routine fixes - it could cause problems if the CV value goes
   down when the flow goes up.

4) Fixed problem in bubble point testers (with no high flow meter) where
   startf parameter was messing up in the parameter editor.

5) Now works with 10 chamber bubble point tester (CHAMBERS=10)

6) Fixed problem where if you closed the test selection screen using
   the close button the test would start - now it acts just as if you
   clicked on the cancel button.

7) Microflow test now waits for differential pressure gauge to return to
   initial value after closing of venting valve before it starts the timer
   to measure the flow rate based on the change in pressure.  This should
   fix the problem with a very small pressure gauge going slightly negative
   when the venting valve is closed.

8) Pressure gauge calibration for a single gauge less than 150 PSI now
   works better - it would previously get the cross-over pressure correctly
   but could over-shoot when doing the secondary check due to too much
   pressure (it incremented the regulator too much).

9) Hydrohead now works with airtop porometers that don't have liquid
   permeability (as long as proper ROM is used with Hydrohead support)
   If your machine has air from the top for the normal air type tests,
   it will now use this air supply to run the hydrohead rather than sending
   all the air pressure through the penetrometer.

Version 6.54.43 4-19-00

1) Changed EFD to jump to near but less than maxflow before taking data.

2) Fixed problem with curve fit program where sometimes it would give
   a subscript out of range error.  This error was introduced in
   version 6.54.42 when the random access files were removed.

3) Fixed problem with another "subscript out of range" error when you
   would abort a two-pass test during the first pass.

4) The sqrt type of "linear dry" is now working.

5) Rewrote valve position communication routine (and temperature
   setting routine) that used binary 16-bit values encoded into
   string variables.  Some values would not work in these routines
   when running an operating system that used 16-bit and 8-bit
   characters (such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.).  The RS232 routine
   now has a second version that takes in a 16-bit number as a
   new final argument.  The string is sent normally, followed by
   the 16-bit number.  In the manual control tempset_click routine,
   the target temperature is now encoded into the pending string
   as base 128 instead of base 256 to avoid this error as well.  Since
   the maximum value is 9999, this still fits into 2 characters, but
   neither of the characters will ever go above 127.  This hasn't been
   tested as we don't have a temperature controller enabled porometer
   in Asia.

6) Modified high flow zero correction slightly in pressure gauge
   calibration function to make it more consistant.  Probably won't
   affect anything on how the calibration works.

7) Changed manual control display format slightly so that pressure units
   greater than 4 characters (such as kg/cm2) will show up properly.

8) Fixed leak test so it properly uses non-PSI units if selected.

9) Fixed problem where "Execute" menu would get re-enabled during test
   setup.  This could allow the user to start another test at the same
   time.

10) The cancel button on the test selection screen now responds to
   the "Esc" key, as all "Cancel" buttons should.

11) Fixed problem with implementation of autofill and airtop - if you
   have feature 16 (meaning airtop) and not autofill you would get an
   incorrect error message

12) Changed pressure drop test control slightly to improve performance.

Version 6.54.42 2-7-00

1) Fixed external frazier pressure gauge implementation

2) Added SC diameter to output. Changed Pressure drop output.

3) Removed all random access files and replaced them with
   dynamic arrays.

4) Added third option (sqrt-based dry curve) to the linear
   dry option.

5) Added support for second penetrometer, which adds valve
   19 (second penetrometer venting valve) and penetrometer
   readings on the auxillary analog port.  To enable this,
   you need to have the auxillary port turned on (feature
   64) and have "Second_Penetrometer=Y" in the capstuff
   section of capwin.ini.  You also need entries for
   2PEN500, 2PEN20500, 2CSECAREA, and 2PSIPERCM for the
   second penetrometer.  If the 20500 count value (PEN20500
   of 2PEN20500) is negative, this means that the penetrometer
   is below the level of the sample chamber and you can't do
   a normal ambient test - if you select an ambient test, the
   program will use the bublflow value to flow gas slowly into
   the top of the penetrometer.  New boolean variable called
   special_ambient is true when using a penetrometer that can
   do this special ambient test.  If you are doing such a test,
   the wet parameter file is selectable from the setup screen,
   and the penetrometer fill procedure has the intial fill
   portion bypassed since the initial fill will happen before
   you seal the sample chamber.

6) Added support back in for autofill.  If "Autofill=Y" is set
   in the INI file, then the 16 of the feature number will be
   used for autofill and not for airtop.  This is needed so
   that older autofill machines (we only made one or two) will
   still work with the new software.

Version 6.54.41 12-20-99

1) Modified curve fit routine so that first and last points
   in each curve do not get modified

2) Fixed interpolation routine (in curve fit and data average)
   so that it will correctly work with dry curves with only
   two data points.  It was dropping the first (highest
   pressure) data point and getting an incorrect last data
   point.  (This last data point was then truncated by the
   report program since it was in the wrong direction, so we
   didn't notice it.)  This fixes a rare problem with lockup
   of the curve fitting routine.

3) Pressure gauge calibration now properly compensates for
   the initial zero flow rate of the high flow meter when
   calibrating the crossover point of the high pressure gauge.

4) Modified external hydrohead test so that it vents the sample
   at the end of the test.

5) Fixed problem where selecting user-defined units would cause
   the flow rate to be invisible during the next test run.  The
   user defined unit would end with a null character which would
   cause the test status screen to stop displaying information
   after the pressure value.

6) Added new capwin.ini value "AirTop", which should be equal to
   "Y" if the air comes from the top of the instrument.  This
   changes the display in manual control.

7) Changed use of the +16 value for the feature number.  It used
   to mean that autofill was present.  We haven't made an auto-
   fill machine since version 5 hardware, and that didn't use
   the feature number, so we have never used the +16 feature
   value.  A +16 now means that there is a liquid drain valve
   on valve 12.  This is only possible on an AirTop machine
   since that would have drain valve 3 above the chamber but
   on a penetrometer system there would still have to be a
   drain valve (12) on the bottom of the chamber.  This valve
   (12) must remain open at all times except for when you are
   filling or refilling the penetrometer.  If +16 is present
   and +8 is not, then we are still a penetrometer system, but
   the drain valve (12) is added and it is a solenoid valve.
   If there is both a +8 and +16, then the drain valve is
   motorized and the position and limits of the drain valve
   are read using the analog input normally used for motorized
   valve 10.  (This means you can't have both a motorized valve
   10 and a motorized valve 12.)  If we ever have to have both
   types in the same machine, we will have to do something
   different.  Since we will be switching to hardware version
   7 soon, and everything will get re-mapped, this shouldn't
   be a problem.

Version 6.54.40 11-23-99

1) Added in pressure drop test

Version 6.54.39 11-18-99

1) Changed hydrohead display of inH2O to cmH2O

2) Increased initial regulator clicks for high flow bubble point

3) Fixed cv calibration and correction code

4) Fixed starting X-Axis label when non-PSI units

5) After bubble point, regulator is reduced until low flow is less
   than 1 cc/min or the pressure starts falling, so that when valve
   2 starts opening the pressure doesn't build up too fast.  This
   gives more data points for some samples

6) On start of up curve, don't increment regulator more until valve
   2 is opened at least 200 counts from the starting position.  This
   prevents the pressure from building up too much before the valve
   has had a chance to really open and get some flow through it.

7) When opening valve 2 during test, each interation must open it at
   least one count, even if the last pulse overshot the target.

8) Wet Up/Linear Dry test now has option to use permeability curve
   for dry in place of linear curve.  It also plots the dry curve
   on the screen.

9) Bubble point is now correctly taken at first pressure where F/PT
   went past the target and stayed there - there were some cases
   where the bubble point pressure would be slightly higher if
   the pressure kept going up after reaching the F/PT target but
   before it had been confirmed.

10) Finished correcting continueing QC WESA error.

11) Added in ability to report permeability/specific surface area/
   bubble point at end of test. Uses the DFG parameter in caprep.ini
   to determine what kind of permeability to show.

12) Fixed calibration problem when using solenoid valve 2

13) If using integrity and compression at the same time, integrity
   flow meter is read using the low range of the low flow meter

14) Fixed "stop at bubble point" in wet up/dry down test - it wasn't stopping.

15) If auto-compression pressure is set to 0, the piston will remain
   retracted and the compression regulator will be set to 20 PSI to keep
   the piston up.  Previously, the piston would be left up but the pressure
   would be set to 0 and on some large pistons this would cause the piston
   to creep down due to gravity.

16) InputMode of MSComm set from text to binary.  This fixes a problem with
   delays in Japanese Windows (which can have two-byte characters, and if the
   binary data we want to get back happens to look like the start of a two-
   byte character, then the control tries to wait for the second byte and
   waits for the timeout value which delays the entire program.  Also switched
   to sending a byte array for output so that it works with non-ascii characters
   (specifically, so the valve position command "G" will work since it sends a
   16-bit binary value for the target position, and if one of these bytes happened
   to be a start of a two-byte character sequence, it wouldn't work properly
   in Japan.

17) Added support for older IBM Interface Board instruments - version 5.3 and 5.31
   which requires new 32-bit DLL for handling INP and OUTP commands to the board.

18) Added the "T" command to determine test enable properties of the ROM.  If the
   instrument is old, the test enable value will default to all on.

Version 6.54.38 8-19-99

1) Added in input for mass and density for surface area analysis
   tests using gas permeability. This corresponds to a change in
   caprep that allows the data to be read in for doing the surface
   area analysis.

2) Added in WESA global to indicate if the machine is only a WESA (E),
   can do WESA (Y), or cannot do WESA (N).

3) Added in machine serial number to data file.

4) Added support for feature bit 1024 - dual regulator.
   This adds valve 17, which switches between the two
   regulators.  Also adds "reg1pmax" for maximum pressure
   on regulator 1.  Also adds valve 18, which is parallel
   to valve 1 but is used with you are using regulator 2

5) Changed CV calibration so that it uses both high flow meters
   (if present).  This should help with low flow CV values.

6) CV calibration and flow calibration now give status messages
   on the screen while they are running.

7) Added experimental external hydrohead chamber - remaps valves
   12, 13, and 14 for pressurize, fill, and vent functions.
   Right now the fill function is not implemented - filling
   is done manually.  Note that this won't work with a microflow
   machine unless valve 14 is used to vent both at the same time
   (which could work since no one would use both fixtures at the
   same time).  INI file has "External Hydrohead=Y" to enable
   this feature.  (You also need to have the proper ROM and
   external hardware or this won't work properly.)

8) Added in Quality Control WESA code which outputs surface area
   and average particle size when the test is done.

9) Corrected QC WESA code.

Version 6.54.37 6-18-99

1) On systems with motorized regulator, cleanout and cv test
   will now start with regulator open to SHFP% point (where
   calibrated low flow rate is above 0.2 cc/min).  This should
   skip over the zero point of the regulator.

2) Fixed alternative fluid output to data file - internally
   the viscosity is embedded with the fluid name.  This is
   split into two lines for the output data file.  Curve
   fit, editor, and averager all thought that the data file
   had the embedded viscosity, so they wouldn't work
   properly.  The normal test data file output was fine.

Version 6.54.36 6-16-99

1) Fixed display problem in data editor where dry curve would
   be stored incorrectly

2) If last file name ends in at least three digits, it will auto-
   increment the number for the next test.  If necessary, it will
   add another character to the file name so x999 -> x1000.
   This can be turned off from execute menu for each user.

3) Display of file names in the test setup form now will use a
   shortened version of the file name if necessary so that the
   text does not wrap to the next line.

4) Auto Increment and Auto Advanced settings are now copied to
   a newly created user group (along with other settings).

5) Test setup screen now correctly shows wet up/linear dry test
   when you change the group to one that has that as the last test.

6) Selection of users is now sorted and scrolls horizontally.

7) User group names can now contain any character that is legal
   for a file name, and can be any length.

8) Bubble point test now displays the bubble point pressure and
   diameter before showing the end of test message box.

9) During initial bubble point, regulator won't increment more than
   one click at a time until it has incremented at least 5 times.
   This is to compensate for some machines where the first click
   doesn't get very much flow but the second one does.  If you click
   multiple times after the first click, you will overshoot the
   target flow rate, and thus may overshoot the bubble point for
   samples with large pores.

10) Added lines to turn off error trapping at several locations
   which otherwise would have unexpectedly left error trapping on.

11) Fixed unit number display - on some windows it was being
    overwritten by later calls to change the caption of the form.

Version 6.54.35 5-6-99

1) Replaced common dialog file selector call to a more direct
call to the WinAPI function.  This both elminates the need
for the common dialog ocx in the installation set (and helps
to solve an incompatability with multiple versions of OCX
files over different versions of Visual Basic) and also
seems to solve a problem with the file selector box always
showing the full path in the file name box, which can be
confusing.  Calls to fsel now need to pass the handle of
the form that is doing the calling.  If a routine in a
module calls fsel, that routine needs to know the handle
of the form that called it.  Because of this, the routine
GetaFile now requires the handle of the form that calls it.
The simplest way to do this is to add me.hwnd to the call.
Using "Me" allows the current form to be renamed without having
to change any code.

2) While doing above, all form self-references are now changed
to using the "Me" word.  This will make it easier to rename
forms.

3) All code that handles units earlier than version 6 is now
commented out.  This code doesn't work with 32-bit mode anyway,
so it is just taking up space.  Since VB5 makes much larger
executable files anyway, it makes sense to preserve space.
Current code now expects that version=6.0 all the time.  It
is only checked on start up now.

4) Win32API calls now correctly updated so that they work with
Windows NT.  Some Integer parameters needed to be changed to
Long parameters to avoid overflow errors.  Win95/98 returns
values less than 65000 for window handles, so integers can
hold the values.  For some reason, NT usually returns handles
greater than 65000, so integer variables cause overflows.

5) User list moved from capwin.ini to capusers.ini inside the default
user name.  The default user name must exist and can not be
deleted.  If the user list is not in the capusers.ini/defualt
then it is either moved from the capwin.ini file (to update
older users) or it is created.  This was done to avoid problems
with people moving the capwin.ini file (which contains all the
instrument hardware information) from one computer to another
and then finding that their user information is messed up.

6) Changed way user groups are deleted from the ini file - now using
one system call with vbNullString argument rather than defining
three different system calls depending on what type of argument
is used.  (vbNullString looks like a string to basic but looks
like a long integer of value 0 to the operating system.)

7) Optional "UnitNumber" entry in capwin.ini defaults to 0 and thus
doesn't show anything.  If other than 0, it will be added to the
title bar of every form to show which unit is being used.  This
makes it easier to run two units on the same computer and avoid
confusion.

Version 6.54.34 3-26-99 to 4-1-99

1) Added readatcheck box and readat label to show status
of auxillary input bits (using the R@ command).  This
if only useful for custom systems that use the auxillary
input bits, and this check box is only visible if
the "READAT" entry in capstuff equals "Y".

2) Removed "extra low flow wet data" box - it now is always
turned off.  This was only needed in one specific
application for a user many years ago.  No current users
are using this feature, and if they turn it on by accident
it can mess up their normal results.  This box is now
replaced by a check box that turns on "advanced mode".
Advanced mode works like the previous version.  If you
are not in advanced mode, then a "lite" test setup screen
is presented first, only allowing you to change the output
file and sample ID.

Version 6.54.33 3-11-99 to 3-23-99

1) Fixed problem with cv calibration where if you had to
retry the calibration the variable that keeps track
of the number of calibration points would be incorrect
leading to an "input past end" error message.

2) Added support for automated compression feature with
compression pressure gauge (high and low range),
motorized pressure regulator for compression pressure,
and compression actuator solenoid valve

3) Added compression pressure regulator calibration
Also - pressure regulator calibration (both types)
now will stop when the regulator reaches the maximum
count value or when the pressure gauge reaches full
scale, whichever comes first.  Both calibrations
use the same form, which determines which regulator
is to be calibrated by the compregcal variable, which
is true only if you are doing the compression regulator
calibration.  Also - if you abort the calibration it
will still save the table of how far you went.

4) Microflow volume can now be calculated on a machine
without a low flow meter - the first high flow meter
is used instead.

Version 6.54.32 8-31-98 to 1-15-99

1) First vb5 32-bit version, being updated at the same time as
6.54.30 16-bit version

2) Merged some support file functions, moved some files into
user directory, changed default directory to c:\program
files\capwin.  Capstuff.dat and board.loc files are now in the
capwin.ini file.  The user information that was in the
capwin.ini file is now in the capusers.ini file.

3) No long works with hardware version less than 6

4) All file access is through the FreeFile command

5) Now works with a 3-chamber bubble point tester.  If
CHAMBERS=3 then it will assume that you have the new
valves A, B, and C for chamber isolation.  Note that
if CHAMBERS=2 then this is for the 2-chamber perm-
porometer, which doesn't have isolation valves.

Version 6.54.31 - reserved number for any final changes to old
16-bit program

Version 6.54.30 Started 8-31-98

1) Fixed problem introduced in version 6.54.29 that would set
the first flow position of valve 2 incorrectly.

2) Apply +40 offset to valve 2 close limit to eliminate
backlash problem.  Also put -40 offset to open limit.

3) Added support for external frazier pressure gauge if
"FrazierPressureGauge" is "Y" in capstuff, the microflow
pressure gauge is replaced by an external Frazier pressure
gauge which is activated when the maxpress parameter is set
less than or equal to the maximum pressure of the diffpg.  If
there is a Frazier pressure gauge, there is no microflow
venting valve.

Version 6.54.29 6-5-98 to 8-31-98

1) Now works with new Bubble Point Tester - feature 32 with
high flow rate set to 0.  Doesn't have high flow meter.  If
feature=288 then has solenoid valve 2, otherwise if climit and
olimit are 0, doesn't have any vale 2.

2) Program now compiled with "Option Explicit" to require all
variables to be declared.  This is being done to prepare the
way for moving to VB5-32.

3) Some variables changed from global to local or global only
to the form they are used in.

4) PulseDelay parameter from default parameters is now used in
elevated pressure liquid permeability to delay from last
increment so avoid false high flow readings caused by the
movement of the float during the rapid increase in pressure.

5) Flow meter calibration now waits longer for stability to
give greater accuracy in bubble point.

Version 6.54.28 May 8, 1998

1) Fixed pressure hold test so it can be aborted if the
pressure doesn't go up during initial pressurizing.

2) Fixed data averaging - all items on modify menu are now
called non-modally and they turn off their menu entries while
they are running.

3) Default version is now 6 so it doesn't mess up too much when
the capstuff file is corrupted.

Version 6.54.27 March 9, 1998

1) Fixed problem in leak test when regtable is empty - this
would cause a "subscript out of range" error

2) If Olimit and Climit are the same, it won't crash.

3) At end of regulator calibration, if valve 2 or regulator
doesn't close all the way to zero, it will still end correctly.

Version 6.54.26 November 22, 1997

1) Changed some colors to make some screens easier to read

2) System now closes valve 1 when entering manual control

3) capstuff can now contain variable reg_pulse_min and
reg_pulse_max, only valid for motorized regulators.  These will
default to 12 and 12 for same increment throughout the range of
the regulator.  Set to 12 and 4 (max=4) for older version
operation.

4) Regulator calibration table now doesn't skip first few
values.

Version 6.54.25 October 8, 1997

1) Added capability for having both penetrometer and microflow
differential pressure gauge in same machine.

Version 6.54.24 July 11, 1997

1) Now allows fluid sensor reading in wet up/dry down test

2) Doesn't allow penetrometer to be pressurized above 200 PSIG

3) Motorized regulator now opens 100 counts less for initial
bubble point pressure to avoid overshooting.

Version 6.54.23 May 22, 1997

1) At the beginning of the test it now waits for a stable
reading on the flow meters before it takes their zero point.
This helps if the test is started immediately after running
large flows through the flow meters and also helps in older 5.1
machines where the regulator is always at least 1 PSI so the
excercize_valve_2 routine can cause some flow.

2) Changed the wait from 10 (readtimes%), to 15 readings, to
test for stability for the flowmeters at the beginning of the
test.

3) Modification in PGCalibrate to properly handle the following
case: Only one absolute pressure gauge with range 250 PSI and
two flow meter with range 30 cc/min and 500L/min.

Version 6.54.22 May 19, 1997

1) All demo modes should now work (they were actually fixed in
a post-final version of 6.54.21)

2) "Temperature=2" added for dual-temperature liquid
permeability testing.

3) On version 6 machines the feature number in the CAPSTUFF
file is now checked (if possible) and compared with the feature
number of the instrument.  Only newer instruments (4-1-97 and
newer) have the capability of reading the feature number.  If
the numbers differ, a warning is given but the machine is still
usable.

4) Timeouts for autofill have been expanded and you can now
purge an autofill system

5) if CAPSTUFF has CHAMBERS=2 then system will support having
two sample chambers, one for gas flow and one for liquid flow.
If this is the case, the end of the liquid permeability test
will change since you can't blow air through the bottom of the
liquid chamber in the same way as you can when one chamber is
used for both.

6) If you abort while waiting for temperature to rise in
elevated temperature liquid permeability you will be given to
option to continue with the test at the current temperature or
cancel the test.

7) Changed V2Percent flagging for versions 5.1 abd lower to
allow exercising V2 very small amounts.  Useful for
archeological style gas permeameters.  The electronic regulator
does not zero.  When v2 is exercised at beginning of test, it
cannot allow flow, or the flowmeter is set above the true zero
unless V2PERCENT is around .5.  BMH 5/7/97

8) V2INCR changed for versions 5.1 or less to allow small
increments for gas permeameters with small flowmeters.  BMH
5/7/97

9) Changed the 75% flow limit warning messagebox for small
flowmeters (such as in a gas permeameter with only one 100cc
flowmeter), 1000 cc or less, to allow full range tests without
the box popping up at the end.  BMH 5/7/97

10) Reformatted the Modify Parameter form to make it easier for
customers to understand BMH 5/16/97

11) System now works properly with 1000 Torr absolute pressure
gauge as the main gauge.  Before, it would give an error
message that the instrument wasn't turned on.

Version 6.54.21 April 14, 1997

1) Fixed pressure gauge calibration routine so it works with
single gauge/single high flow meter machines.

2) Remove integrity test option on machines that do not have
integrity flow meter.  (Older program would use low flow meter
to simulate integrity test and it didn't work very well.)

3) Fixed divide-by-zero error in microflow volume calibration
if pressure fails to increase (because of a leak or something
like that).  It will now display a message saying that the
pressure is not rising and that there is a possible leak.  If
the leak is sealed and the pressure starts to rise then the
normal % and cc readings will be displayed.

4) Added support for "PMI Integrity Tester" which requires that
the integrity flow meter is installed (new variable integrity%)
and that the high flow meter is not installed (high and low
range of high flow meter set to 0 cc/min).  This turns on new
variable itester%, changes some of the captions, and disables
capflow and gas perm tests, leaving only integrity, bubble
point and pressure hold tests.  An Integrity Tester should not
have an extra high flow meter or penetrometer.  Adds the
feature number addition of 256 which means that valve 2 has
been replaced by a solenoid valve and doesn't need to exercise
or anything like that.  This is new variable v2solenoid%.  Note
that it is posslbe to have an integrity tester with a motorized
valve 2, but this would be a waste of hardware.

5) Fixed problem with filename correction (added in 6.54.06)
that would mess up if your path contained a folder with an
extension in its name.  Also updated file selector so it could
trap the user selecting a file name exactly the same as an
existing folder in the same path.

6) Parameters that are not used in a particular machine will
not show up in the editor.

7) Square Pore settings, if available, are now working
correctly.  On some systems if you selected Square Pores it
would remain set even if you told it to turn them off.

Version 6.54.20 March 17, 1997

1) Added support for temperature controller on auxillary input.
This is turned on by adding "TEMPERATURE=Y" to the capstuff
file.  Also add "TSX0=500", "TSX1=20500", "TSY0=0", and
"TSY1={whatever max really is}" and "TSUNIT={name of units}"
This will change the auxillary reading into a "Temperature"
reading in whatever units you specify.  It will also enable the
temperature output and allow the user to set the temperature of
the sample chamber for liquid permeability tests.

2) When autofill is refilling penetrometer it now gives a
status screen showing penetrometer value as it fills.

3) Fixed problem where when you selected a new type of test it
would then mess up the user selection box the next time you
used it.

4) Fixed curve fit, editor, and averager to use secondary fluid
specification in liquid and gas permeability files.  They
should also work with auxillary input fluid sensor files.

5) Added in capstuff variable "Compression=Y" for machines with
compression capabilities.

Version 6.54.19 January 24, 1997

1) Fixed max liquid flow for older style autofills - pulsing of
drain valve after penetrometer fill was causing too much drop
in penetrometer on slow computers.

2) Changed captions on leak test - it shows absolute pressure
but put a "D" after the units, which not only was wrong, but
was also confusing for any unit other than PSI.  It now shows
the pressure unit and then " (Absolute)".

3) Added user-adjustable tortuosity factor

4) Disabled Execute and Calibrate menus when anything is
currently being executed or calibrated.  This stops two
routines from trying to control the instrument at the same
time.  (They would step on each other and cause problems.)

Version 6.54.18 December 2, 1996

1) Added pressure gauge calibration routine

2) Added support for fluid sensor on auxillary input.  This is
turned on by adding "FLUIDSENSOR=Y" to the capstuff file.  Also
add "FSX0=500", "FSX1=20500", "FSY0=0", and "FSY1={whatever max
really is}" and "FSUNIT={name of units}" This will change the
auxillary reading into a "Fluid Sensor" reading in whatever
units you specify.  It will also turn on two new CFP tests for
WUDU and DUWU with fluid sensor.  These tests add some changes
to the CFP file, so a new report program will be required.

3) New Select_Test box with added options for microflow
porometry and nowait on wet up/dry up.  Microflow is now a
selectable option for capflow tests.  Setting MAXFLOW to 1 is
no longer required and may cause problems.  (feature 6 in
version 6.54.17 is no longer valid)

4) Alter Cover now uses rp_cover.txt in main directory rather
than one in user directory which wasn't working properly with
current report program.

Version 6.54.17 September 12, 1996

1) Removed upper limit on max.  dist.  between points in curve
fit.  You can now enter as large a number as you like.  (If
your number is greater than the maximum pressure in the test,
it will have no effect.)

2) New routine for "extra low flow wet data" test - resets
regulator after bubble point so that there is only small amount
of flow through low flow meter.  Old routine zeroed regulator,
which would cause long time delay while pressure built up
again.

3) When you rename a group it now deletes the old group
information.  It used to just leave the old group information
in the INI file.

4) Caption changed in unit conversion box to give more
information.

5) "End User" and "Test Reference" labels don't get changed to
"line 1" and "line 2" - they stay the way they should be.

6) New diff.  pressure gauge based porometry tests using diff.
pg in place of a flow meter to measure very small flows.
Parameter file must have maxflow rate of 1 cc/min to turn on
this feature.

7) When running new diff.  pressure gauge based test, status
line now shows differential pressure gauge reading and doesn't
show flow meter reading.  (The flow meter reading is ignored in
this test.)

8) Added additional manual control for motorized pressure
regulator

9) Now uses MSCOMM.VBX for communications with version 6
instruments if you are using comm ports 1 through 4.  Will
still work with PMI comm board.  MSCOMM.VBX must now be
included on install disk.

10) Turn, Abort, and Manual buttons only work when you are in
hold.  Hold may be delayed in taking effect while some tasks
that can't be interrupted easily are going on.

11) Added support for features 64 (aux.  analog input) and 128
(microflow diffpg) in version 6.0.

12) Fixed problem on some version 6.0 machines where low
pressure gauge safety valve (valve 11) would be closed at the
wrong time.

13) Added support for gas permeameter - same as capflow but
with no valve 1 or low flow meter, thus no bubble point or
porometry tests.  You turn on this feature by setting the high
range of the low flow meter to 0.  (You also have to set the
low range of the low flow meter to -1 to shut off the integrity
meter option.)

14) CV calibration now uses slower regulator increments if the
maximum flow rate is less than 50 l/min.

15) Will now work with CV table with only one value or a table
where the values keep increasing to the end.  Older program
assumed that the CV table would go up and then decrease near
the end.

Version 6.54.16 August 1, 1996

1) Added 0.1 second delay when pulsing valve closed to overcome
race condition in older version 5.3 small instrument board that
would allow valve 2 to close beyond the normal close limit when
pulsed on some instruments.

2) Fixed bug where if you edited the parameter file from the
auto test setup box and changed the name of the parameter file
when you stored it, the changed name would show up on the setup
box but the old name would be actually used for running the
test.

3) Microflow test start prompt changed and protection added for
microflow pressure gauge in manual control.

4) Put MaxAirFlow routine back in cV calibration - it was left
out of version 6.54.15

5) MaxHighFlow variable holds original high range of regular
high flow meter, and this variable is used to compare to
MaxFlow parameter to determine which flow meter is used in the
test.  This replaces the comparison with the FY2 variable that
holds the current high range since this variable can change
slightly during the test as the flow meter is recalibrated and
this can cause the wrong flow meter to be used in the second
half of a capflow porometry test in some cases.

6) Added preliminary demo mode for version 6

7) Version 6 hardware can now set the com port from the calib
menu.

8) Added new "Wet up, Dry dn bp" test which will do a wet up,
dry down and automatically stop when the pressure down is less
than the bubble point (after a stable reading is taken).

9) "New User" copies linear and thickness units from current
user

10) All capflow tests now have extended report info that says
what type of test was actually run.

11) Data points are stored with equilibrium coding added to the
spacing of the numbers.  The data points consist of a flow
rate, a comma, and a pressure value.  There is always a space
before the flow rate.  There is an optional space after the
flow rate before the comma and an optional space after the
comma and before the pressure value.  The coding is as follows:
A space before and after the comma means that the first
equilibrium routine was used.  No space before the comma and a
space after the comma means that the second equilibrium routine
was used.  A space before the comma and no space after the
comma means that the user forced the data point to be taken.
No spaces either before or after the comma means that the
alternative background equilibrium routine was used.  Note that
this is not used with some of the special equilibrium options
such as when aveiter=0.

12) Elevated pressure liquid permeability now asks for starting
pressure.

13) Parameter file(s) used are now stored as extended values in
data files

14) Deleting a group name now actually removes the group
information from the CAPWIN.INI file.  Before, it would remove
the group name from the list but all the information would
still be taking up space in the INI file.

15) Added message box to abort button to verify that you really
mean it.

Version 6.54.15 April 16, 1996

1) Added "Wet Up/Linear Dry" to capillary flow porometry type
tests.  This will run the wet curve normally and then
extrapolate a linear dry curve based on the maximum flow rates
and pressures of the wet curve.  The dry curve will be linear
except for the constraint that it does not go below the wet
curve.

2) CV pressure correction reformulated for greater accuracy at
low pressures

3) New estimated bubble point pressure routine speeds test time

4) New Bloop helps maintain and achieve bublflow more precisely

5) New five_to_one variable in capstuff file now lets us know
that the Maximum attainable pressure is 30 PSIG.  This is in
use for the leak test and the autoparms setting of maxpres.
Also changed leak test such that the user cannot enter a
pressure over the range of the high pressure gauge else an
error message is returned and the leak test aborted.  I think
that the variable reg5% will be very usefull for future
programmers who wish to optimize the code for low pressure
samples etc.

6) Initial support for a user directory - used for rp_cover.txt
report cover file

7) Support for version 6 feature number 32 (pneumatic
regulator)

Version 6.54.14 March 26, 1996

1) changed valve test routine from 5000 to 4500 cts.  This
reflects the count value that is the true maximum close limit
and minimum open limit.  Some very small travel valves can't
get to 5000 but all valves must be able to get to 4500.

2) It now closes the low pressure gauge valve during BEFORE
estimated bubble point if the estimated pressure is greater
than the range of the lowpg.

3) If the user saves a new parameter file in AutoParm, the
AutoTest screen will show that new file in either/both the Wet
Curve and the Dry Curve.

4) Inserted a message box to ask the user which Curve parameter
file to edit if the 2 files are different and neither is
checked.  (DWW)

5) Whenever the OK button is made visible on the Msgform, the
focus is also set to it.

6) the find volume routine has been rewritten

7) pressure generator increments for version 6 change the pulse
width (cmd J) depending on the current position.  At start they
use 12.  At end they use 4.

8) graph in pressure hold test fixed

9) execercise_valve_2 timer modified - if the valve stops
before the close limit, it will retry four times before saying
it is out of calibration.  This may cure the false valve
calibration message.

10) Cleanout routine makes sure that extra pressure gauge is
protected

11) Pressure regulator calibration (version 6) make sure extra
pressure pressure gauge is protected

12) Fixed rare case where low estimated bubble point pressure
on machine with only one pressure gauge would try to read
nonexistant extra pressure gauge.

13) New parameter in CAPSTUFF: PSIPERCC = PSI/MIN increase per
CC/MIN flow into system during hydrohead test.  If this
parameter is present, the hydro- head test will ask for rate of
pressure increase.  If not present, it will ask for the flow
rate.

Version 6.54.13 March 15, 1996

1) New "HydroHead" test for Perm-Porometers with optional
hydrohead modification.

2) Selection box cancel now works properly

3) I/O board calibration now works properly - it wasn't saving
board.loc file in proper place.

4) initial valve 2 testing should now be faster

5) Internal variables keep track of the last state of the
pressure regulator.  If you last zeroed the regulator, it
doesn't bother to zero it again at the beginning of the next
test.  Note that this variable is cleared when you enter
CAPWIN, so it will always zero the regulator again the first
time through.

6) Added second, stronger warning at end of liquid permeability
test to try to make sure that the user has drained the liquid
from the sample chamber.

7) Integrity test now works in hardware version 6 machines

8) New optional parameter in CAPSTUFF: V2Percent = 0 to 100
This lists the percent open you want v2 for estimated bubble
point pressurization, integrity test, and elevated pressure
liquid permeability.  If you don't put anything, it is assumed
to be 100%.  Don't set this value too low or your tests may not
work!  This is only to speed things up a bit so you don't have
to wait as long for the valve to open all the way.

9) When you are asked to refill the penetrometer, you can now
click on "Stop Test" and abort the test.

10) Special debug mode added - not selectable by normal users

11) Integrity test now asks for starting pressure

12) HydroHead test now asks for starting pressure

13) Bubltime changed to F/PT (average flow / pressure change *
time) This only affects the name of the variable, not its
function.

14) You can now set the maximum pressure parameter down to 0.
Previous minimum value was 1.

15) New optional parameter in CAPSTUFF: 3WayValve = Y This
means you have a 3-way protection valve on the low pressure
gauge and thus if the low pressure gauge is over pressure it
doesn't need to give an error until after it closes the 3-way
valve to vent the pressure.

16) Timer doesn't start until actual testing starts

Version 6.54.12: February 2, 1996

1) Fix display of penetrometer venting valve in manual control.
This was done incorrectly in version 6.54.08.  The valve
displays in the opposite manner from the actual valve position.

2) Added new "Air Bubble Purge" for non-autofill
perm-porometers

3) Fixed initialization of Pass variable - caused problems on
second run

4) Fixed parameter editor dirty flag - won't tell you things
have changed if they haven't.

5) New Parallel stability mode - if readings are unstable but
aren't going anywhere, forces reading after 30 seconds.

6) Regulator calibration for version 6

Version 6.54.11: January 10, 1996

1) Removed Add and Remove Test

2) Corrected a couple of spelling mistakes

3) In AutoParm Form, added the string to be saved to the MsgBox
statement for saving

4) Corrected glitch in AutoTest screen whereby changing the
user would not update all features of the AutoTest screen.

5) Added feature which allows the user to change a group name
(Its useful for when the technicians spell a group name
incorrectly).

Version 6.54.10: January 4, 1996

1) On the Progress Form, displayed both the filename and the
sample ID above the graph.

2) Removed Microflow Analysis from Add/Remove Test from fear of
user confusion.  The group felt that user would add the test,
not knowing that you needed an entirely different machine.

3) Added a feature which allows the user to change the user
from within the Autotest form.  When this is done, it also
updates the necessary components on the main screen.

Version 6.54.09: December 29, 1995

1) Added standard Small Instrument Board Calibration Module

Version 6.54.08: December 26, 1995

1) In version 6, the regulator now moves based on the
pulsewidth and the capcal.d8a file for version 6 stores
regulator counts rather than clicks.  Since no version 6
machines have been shipped yet, this change in protocol will
not affect customers.

2) Added new Manual Control with shapes in place of a painted
drawing - this makes updates easier.

3) New manual control is more multi-tasking "friendly".

4) Fixed slight problem in diffperm volume calibration.

5) Protection for low pressure gauge is now fixed - valve will
automatically shut off the gauge when you are in manual control
if the pressure goes over 23000 counts, and valve will not open
if the pressure on the main pressure gauge is over the top
pressure rating of the low pressure gauge.

Version 6.54.07

1) Changed appearance of Title Screen.

2) Added feature in Modify Menu which allows user to add any
type of non-standard CapWin Test.  Thus far, there are only 2
such tests, Microflow and Square Pore Analysis.

3) Added PC board calibration to calibrate menu.  (DWW)

4) Changed how high low pressure gauge could go without causing
error during test.

Version 6.54.06

1) Corrected file name entry problem.  In TestScrn, there were
no checks on a correct filename, hence ending a filename with
"." or ".bla" was acceptable.  Filenames now end with ".cft"
regardless of user entry.  (DWW)

Version 6.54.05: November 10, 1995

1) Added test of low pressure gauge during the test to make
sure that the valve is not leaking.

2) Also added way of reading low pressure gauge while leaving
the valve closed.

3) Manual control now shows correct position of low pressure
valve at all times.

4) In manual control added shift-I and shift-D to increment and
decrement by 10.

5) Added new machine type with 'DIFFPG="Y"' in Capstuff file
for adding a low pressure gauge after the sample chamber.
Valve 14 now drains this gauge.

6) New type of test - diffusion permeability - and new
diffusion permeability volume calibration if DIFFPG="Y".

7) Added linear_unit_name$, linear_unit_conversion# (to cm),
thick_unit_name$, and thick_unit_conversion#

Version 6.54.04: May 18, 1995

1) Modified regular equilibrium routine so that during wet up
it will not let the pressure fall back.  (Similar problem to
that solved in 6.53.30, but seen less often.)

2) Changed penetrometer autofill routine to compensate for
transition point between offscale and in-scale values.  Some
penetrometers have a small region where incorrect seeminly
in-scale values are read, and this could cause the autofill to
stop prematurely.

3) Also added capstuff parameter "TopFill" which is equal to
"Y" when you have a new top filling autofill.

Version 6.54.03: April 17, 1995

1) Fixed slight noise that would sound when valve 2 pulsed
during the automated test.  This was caused by a race condition
between the valve 2 pulse routine and the read gauge routine
and only happen on faster computers.  It was also only
noticable with new style skinner valves since the new style
valves make much more noise when they close than the old style
skinner valves.  This noise was not causing any trouble with
the operation of the machine or the reliability of the results,
but the customer objected to the noise.

Version 6.54.02: April 13, 1995

1) Modified routine during wet curve when pressure falls.

2) Fixed potential problem when using 5000 Torr gauge with 1000
Torr gauge because high range of 1000 Torr gauge is same as (or
higher if 1000 Torr is differential) than 5000 Torr gauge low
range which could mess up gauge recalibration routine.

Version 6.54.01: March 7, 1995

1) Rewrote gauge calibration during auto test (again!).  This
version remembers counts at atmospheric pressure, and
atmospheric pressure, and whenever a gauge's conversion values
are changed it makes sure that it would still read atmospheric
pressure if the count value was set back to what it was at
atmospheric pressure.  If this works, it will be used later in
a seperate gauge calibration routine.

2) "Record" button is ignored within one second of reading a
value.  This will stop the program from taking a data point too
soon.  What can happen is that the user presses the Record
button, thinking that the point was taking too long to reach
stability when in fact it had just reached stability and was
storing the result to the disk file.  The "Record" button is
then used to force the NEXT data point will then be taken
immediately, not allowing any time for the reading to
stabilize.

Version 6.54.00: March 1, 1995

1) First version to work with prototype high pressure capflow
using serial port and George CPU board.  Will also work with
older machines.

2) Advanced bubble point routine is now defaulted to "0", which
means that it won't be turned on unless the user specifically
selects it.  On a new installation or when updating an older
installation that didn't have this routine available, this
routine will be disabled.

Version 6.53.31: January 11, 1995

1) When running bubble point test, message would display saying
that there was something wrong with your data when there wasn't
anything wrong at all.  Fixed.

Version 6.53.30: December 1994

1) Modified new equilibrium routine (AveIter=0) so that during
wet up it will not let the pressure fall back.  (On some
samples, the pressure rises, pores are opened, and then the
increased flow causes the pressure to drop, leading to improper
results.)

2) Added menu item to turn off the advanced low flow readings.

3) Fixed initial scale of test screen.

4) Changed pressure gauge re-calibration so that when you
switch from the low to high pressure gauges, it does an offset
shift, and when you switch from low to high range on the same
gauge, it does a scale shift.

Version 6.53.29

1) Changed gauge re-calibration when changing range during an
automated test.  It now shifts the Y2 value as opposed to the
Y1 value, and if the Y2 value is being told to shift by more
than 10%, it doesn't do it (it assumes that it is in error)

2) Fixed file selector call in data editor for saving
permeability curve - I/O flag was set wrong so you couldn't
save to a new file that didn't already exist.

Version 6.53.28

1) Modified section of gauge reading routine where range
switches.  It used to read low range and then read the high
range and reset the high reading to equal the low reading.  It
now reads the low, then high, then low again and makes the high
reading equal to the average of the two low readings.  This
should make the crossover smoother when the flow is changing
rapidly.

2) Changed bubltime value for offscale readings (when pressure
didn't go up) from 1000 to 99999.

3) Changed new stability routine (when AveIter=0) so it looks
at both phase shifts in pressure as well as flow (old new
routine only looked at flow phase shifts)

Version 6.53.27: September 5, 1994

1) Rewrite of gas selector for gas or liquid permeability test.
Now has option buttons for each valid gas, plus area for
typeing in your own gas or liquid and its associated viscosity
value.  Requires CAPREP version 6.53.13 or higher to process
files with custom gas or liquid names and viscosities.

Version 6.53.26

1) Made sure that SHFP was at least 3 clicks on the regulator.
This insures that there will be at least some pressure when it
starts the dry curve.

2) Dry down curve can now end when valve 2 is within 1% of it's
close limit.

3) Fixed file selector for when initial path is not valid, such
as when you remove the A disk from the drive.

4) Reads high flow meter once before moving valve 2 so correct
high flow meter is selected earlier to allow it to settle in
better.

5) Fixed some lockups at end of dry down curve where valve 2
would not close all the way because it was being pulsed very
slowly.

Version 6.53.25

1) New expanded bubble point routine.  Once bubble point has
been reached, if pressure is still going up, increases flow
into system and keeps taking points based on low flow meter
until flow into system is same as maximum on low flow meter and
flow out of system is same as flow into system (pressure has
not increased).

2) Increased shown resolution of PulseWidth parameter on
parameter editor.

3) Added new routine to keep NOWHERE% counter at 2 if either
pressure or flow is improving.

4) Changed SHFP definition from 2 cc/min low flow to .2 cc/min
low flow.  This is the number of counts that the regulator is
clicked before it starts to open valve 2.  This should lower
the minimum pressure possible for gas permeability and dry
tests.

5) When buble point is done, regulator is zeroed and then set
to SHFP.

Version 6.53.24: August 5, 1994

1) Display of maximum pressure on Y axis of pressure hold test
fixed.  If you were using non-PSI units it would display the
wrong value, and if this value took up too much space, it would
wrap to the next line and become virtually invisible.

Version 6.53.23:

1) The new file selector was implemented.  See documentation
about this file selector

2) Aborting from a leak test has been improved.

3) During the special fast test, the pressure regulator is
incremented only once until some real data point is actually
taken.  It then increments the number of times specified in the
parameter file.

4) A new Pressure Regulator Increment Factor is used to
increase the number of clicks of the pressure regulator as the
test progresses to try to achieve an even distribution of data
points throughout the test.

5) The maximum value for parameter PREGINC raised from 10 to
30.

6) The end of the liquid permeability test was rewritten to try
to avoid getting fluid in the flow meters.

7) The determination of the presence of the integrity meter was
changed.  The range of the integrity meter is stored in the
CAPSTUFF file in place of the low range of the low flow meter.
Before, if the low range of the low flow meter was listed as

higher than the high range of the low flow meter, this meant
that there was an integrity meter installed.  This caused
problems when the integrity meter was the same range as the low
flow meter.  The new definition is if the low range of the low
flow meter is greater than or equal to one half of the high
range of the low flow meter then the integrity meter is
installed.  (The low range of the low flow meter is usually 2/5
of the high range of the low flow meter.) Note that the low
range of the low flow meter is never used for any actual
readings, though it is available in manual control if the
integrity meter is not present.

8) The initial fill routine for the autofill machine has been
changed.  Whenever it stops filling by closing the water inlet
valve, it opens and then closes the drain valve to relieve the
pressure below the sample.  This stops the water from
continuing to go up in the penetrometer and overflowing.  Also,
when the water first reaches the penetrometer, the program
stops the water (and pulses the drain valve) and observes the
motion of the water.  If it goes up, it remembers how much it
went up from when it was stopped.  It then resumes the water
flow and stops it early based on the amount of the previous
overshoot to avoid overfilling.

9) Before, if they created a new group, it would show the group
as the current group but would not save this information to the
disk so when they entered the program again it wouldn't
remember that this was their last selected group.  (If they
selected the group after creating it, it worked correctly.)
This is now fixed.

10) If they try to run the machine when the main pressure gauge
reads below 5000 counts on the low range, it warns them that
their machine may be turned off.  (The main pressure gauge is
an absolute gauge, so it should always read at least 14 PSI,
and on the low range of a 10,000 Torr gauge this would always
be at least 7000 counts).  If we ever use a gauge higher than
10,000 Torr, this may need to be changed.

11) Fixed a few cases where the mouse pointer remained in the
busy state after you canceled a procedure.  There may still be
others left to fix.

Version 6.53.22:

1) Fixed auto-test setup screen initialization.  When the last
test was a liquid permeability test, it showed the line asking
for surface tension of the fluid when this was not necessary.

2) Fixed problem where if you aborted during the first pass of
a wet/dry test during the bubble point, the second pass would
start and then abort.  It now aborts more cleanly.

3) You can now abort from a bubble point if you estimate too
high a pressure and it can't reach that pressure.

4) Printout from the auto parameters editer now matches the
screen layout (because of new parameter that was added).

5) The CV calculation now records how many regulator clicks
were used to determine the CV, and if the user tells the
program to retry, it starts at that many clicks to start with.
This allows the CV test to go to higher pressures and flows,
especially if you have an air compressor that runs out of air
during the CV test.

6) When you retry the CV test, the program now correctly
displays the old CV value.  (It used to be messed up on the
screen during a retry of CV.)

Version 6.53.21:

1) New bubble point options for large filters.

2) Made turnaround flag seperate from other flags so you can
click on the turnaround button and then on the record button
and force it to take the next point and then turn around.
(Before, both buttons used the same flag, so clicking on the
record button would clear the status of the turnaround button.)

3) Added MINBPPRES parameter.  The routine won't take the
bubble point at a pressure below MINBPPRES.  This parameter is
added to the end of the parameter list (though it is inserted
near the beginning of the editor screen) and if this parameter
is not in the parameter list file, it will be set to zero,
which will do exactly what the program did before this
parameter was present.  Whenever a parameter file is written
out, this parameter will be added to the end of the file.

4) Changed the Max.  Liqild Flow test so that if the
penetrometer does not fill at all during the first 30 seconds,
when you tell it to retry, it will go back to the beginning of
the fill procedure.  (It used to go to the middle of the fill
procedure which would only allow the water to fill for an
addition second before warning you that it wasn't filled.  It
now gives you an additional 30 seconds.)

Version 6.53.20:

1) Traps lockup that happened when the CAPCAL.D8A file was
corrupted or missing.  It now warns you that you need to
recalibrate the flows.

Version 6.53.19:

1) Fixed wet up/dry down test.  Before, the dry down test would
end if the flow was over the maximum flow parameter, which it
could be if the wet up test ended because of the flow.  The
flow can now be anything during the dry down portion.

2) Fixed liquid permeability display so screen doesn't scroll
back to top when every data point.

3) Fixed manual liquid fill display to show you the counts
during the fill, even after the program thinks you are done.

4) Added constantly updated status line to liquid permeability
to show liquid height, pressure, and time.

5) Added more "DoEvents" calls inside timing loops so program
works better when other programs are running.

Version 6.53.18:

1) New parameter CFANAL added to CAPSTUFF file.  If this
parameter is equal to "Y", this means that the machine will
call itself a "Complete Filter Analyzer".  If this parameter is
"N" or missing, the machine will call itself either a
"Capillary Flow Porometer" or an "Automated Perm-Porometer",
depending on whether or not is has liquid permeability.

Version 6.53.17:

1) Updated high-flow bubble point so it works the same as the
low-flow bubble point.  Both routines are now implemented with
the same set of code (they used to be different routines) so
when one is updated, both will be updated.

Version 6.53.16:

1) New routine when parameter AVEITER is set to 0 (a previously
illegal value): The stability routine will read the flow twice
and note the direction it is going in.  It will then wait until
the direction changes the same number of times as the EQITER
parameter or until the elapsed time equals the MINEQTIME
parameter.  By setting EQITER=0 and MINEQTIME=0 you will wait
no time at all.  By setting EQITER=999999, you will wait the
MINEQTIME for each point.  By setting MINEQTIME=9999999, you
will always wait for EQITER direction changes.

2) Allows zero flow to be stored in data files.  Before, it
would always store a flow of 1 in place of a flow of zero or
negative values, and this messed up things with very low flow
samples.  CAPREP has also been modified to allow gas
permeability files to have zero flows in them.

3) Fixed typeing error which caused EQITER parameter to remain
as it was in the default parameter file and not be updated to
the value it was set to in the user's desired parameter file
for an automated test.  All other user desired parameters were
updated correctly, but EQITER remained as it was set in the
default parameter file.  This error originated in version 6.0
or 6.1 (the Quick Basic CAPNEW version) as it was not present
in the GWBASIC versions (5.3 and lower).

4) EQITER and AVEITER are now allowed to go to 0 in the
parameter editor.

5) Fixed starting flow on screen graph to correctly reflect
STARTF in user's testing parameter file.

6) Changed system so that valve select lines and direction line
all go back to zero when no valve is actually moving.  This
happens whenever a flow meter or pressure gaugs is read and no
valve is currently energized.  This is meant to fix a strange
bug that causes the high flow meter to shift its zero point
depending on the status of the direction line.  The valve
status lines are zeroed just in case they cause problems.  The
actual hardware cause of this problem has not been determind
yet.

Version 6.53.15:

1) Fixed TIME1K calling problem in manual control for pulse of
valve 2.

Version 6.53.14:

1) Adds new "Fast Regulator" mode with valve percentage
setting.  If you set the "PULSEWIDTH" parameter to zero in your
testing parameter file (DO NOT SET THIS TO ZERO in the Default
file), then the V2INCR parameter will be used to set the
percentage open of valve 2 for the test, and all pressure
increments will be done with the regulator.  This is mainly
used for the high flow machine.

Version 6.53.13:

1) Turns on demo mode if the value in the board.loc file is 0.
This value is normally the location of the start of the
interface board, and is set to 544 for most boards (hex value
$220).

Version 6.53.12:

1) Due to bugs in using true type fonts, reverted to using
NEWBET.DLL file for hardware communication and font rotation.
TIME1K is now implemented directly and doesn't need an extra
DLL file.  (It calls the TOOLHELP.DLL, which is a normal part
of the operating system.)

Version 6.53.11:

1) Replaced BET.DLL and NEWBET.DLL with PMI.DLL, which was
compiled in GFA-Basic for Windows.  This adds a 1/1000 sec
timer (TIME1K), which removes the need for the file
PROCSPED.D8A and all timing calibration (which was the beep and
delay when you entered the program some times).  (The
experimental PMI.DLL was discarded in the next version)

Version 6.53.10:

1) Added corrected help links.

2) Displays penetrometer readings during refill.

3) Fixed penetrometer fill waiting so that liquid must go up to
half-way point before it will terminate when count goes off
scale.  (Previously, if you filled slightly and then let the
level drop so it was off scale on the bottom end, it thought
that the penetrometer was filled.)

4) Fixed display of pressures during leak test for non-PSI
units and user input of maximum pressure during liq.  perm.  to
differential.

Version 6.53.09:

1) Fixed bug in P0FIRST correction.

Version 6.53.08:

1) Fixed bug in "About Capwin"

Version 6.53.07:

1) Added STR$ to all print # commands.  This fixes problem when
using program under Windows when comma is used as a decimal
seperator (Europe, etc.).

Version 6.53.06:

1) Removed parameter "Special1".  Its function can be duplcated
by setting AVEITER to zero.  Added parameter "PulseDelay" in
its place, which is a delay time after each increment of the
pressure regulator during bubble point.

Version 6.53.05:

1) Added warnings for off scale low pressure gauge and tighter
criteria before doing extra interpolated data points.

Version 6.53.04:

1) Fixed problems when using version 5.2 instruments.

Version 6.53.03:

1) Moved "Refill Penetrometer" message to after zeroing
pressure.

Version 6.53.02:

1) Cleaned up Reply% initialization for some message boxes.

Version 6.53.01:

1) Cleaned up some things in the test selection box.

Version 6.53.00:

1) Converted probrmam to Visual Basic version 3.00

Version 6.52.06:

1) Fixed special stuff for hollow samples.

Version 6.52.05:

1) Support for hollow samples added to data file, test setup,
and all other programs.  In data format, if diameter read in is
0, new next line contains Diam, Cyl_Len.  Otherwise, Cyl_Len is
set to 0 to signify that the sample is flat.

Version 6.52.04:

1) Message that valve 2 needs to be calibrated now aborts the
test.

Version 6.52.03:

1) Changed the penetrometer messages for better readability.

2) Text inputs for auto-test setup now are highlighted for
easier editing.

Version 6.52.02:

1) Bug fixed to allow leaktest to run beyond midnight.

2) timer bar added to leaktest wait.

Version 6.52.01:

1) "Credit" text added, including version number updates

2) Leaktest changed to differential pressure

Versions before this did not have updates noted.
